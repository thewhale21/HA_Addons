## 2.96.8 — Schedule: a saving session's charge drawn next to the slot it joins

- **Improvement:** the charge before a saving session, joined on to one of
  your slots, was drawn over the end of that slot, so the slot looked as if
  it had been taken over. The slot is now drawn for its own times and the
  charge (striped purple) as a piece of its own next to it, as the
  automatic schedule's charging is. It still charges straight through: one
  charge, plugged in from one to the other.

## 2.96.7 — Schedule: skip, delete and Charge now from a page that's behind

- **Fix:** skipping one of the automatic schedule's blocks just after it
  planned again failed with "No such schedule time" (the block had a new
  id). The page now sends each time's date and time too, so the block at
  the same time is found.
- **Fix:** deleting one of its blocks just after it planned again did
  nothing (since 2.96.6 the block, with its new id, was kept as one the page
  hadn't seen). The block at the same time is deleted.
- **Improvement:** where the block has moved since (planned at another
  time), a skip or delete isn't guessed at: you're asked to have a look and
  try again.
- **Improvement:** Charge now's "over the daily limit" question asks again,
  with the new plan, if what it would do changed between asking and you
  pressing Charge anyway.

## 2.96.6 — Schedule: blocks no longer vanish when you add a slot

- **Fix:** adding a time slot (e.g. on a later day) just after the
  automatic schedule had planned again made its blocks disappear, then
  come back about 15 seconds later. The page saved the blocks it had
  before the replan, with ids the add-on no longer knew, so they were
  dropped. Blocks planned again at the same time now keep their ids, and
  the page sends the ids it had, so anything the add-on put in since
  (that the page never saw) is kept. Only a block you delete is taken out.

## 2.96.5 — Schedule: no stray times from a page that was behind

- **Fix:** saving from the page just after the automatic schedule was
  turned off (before the page had caught up) put its blocks back as times
  nothing kept track of, so leftovers stayed for good (e.g. an unplug only
  at 20:30). The add-on's own times it has already taken out aren't put
  back, and any of the automatic schedule's still to come that nothing keeps
  track of are cleared when it plans again or is turned off.

## 2.96.4 — Sessions: the automatic schedule's earlier sessions

- **Fix:** turning the automatic schedule off took its blocks that had
  already run out of the schedule too, so the Sessions tab only showed it
  for the sessions since it was last turned on. They're kept (14 days, as
  other one-offs) for the Sessions tab, and still taken out of the
  schedule.

## 2.96.3 — Tests: logging left on

- **Fix:** the schedule scenarios (tests/schedule_scenarios.py) turned
  logging off when imported, so under pytest it stayed off for every test
  (test_debug_tools' log buffer came back empty). It's only turned off while
  the scenarios run, or when run by hand.

## 2.96.2 — Schedule: the rest of the run-ons

The random scenarios now match the page more closely (no slot moved onto
another of yours, auto plug-in only when not plugged in) and 698 of 700
leave nothing plugged in with no end:

- **Fix:** skipping a slot of yours a charge had joined (e.g. auto plug-in
  while your slot ran) left the charge running on: it ends at its own
  unplug again.
- **Fix:** a charge planned while one of the automatic schedule's blocks
  was going, with that block's end moved by you, joined everything up to
  the next day (the block's moved end was taken out first).
- **Fix:** deleting part of a slot moved for a saving session could take
  out the end of the part left (when its plug-in was skipped by the
  automatic schedule just then), and kept your slot's own end skipped.
- **Fix:** joining a charge to the slots it meets counted the automatic
  schedule's skips on your slots without its blocks, so your slots looked
  as if they ran on and a charge could join a whole day.

## 2.96.1 — Schedule: more left plugged in, fixed

More from the random scenarios (now 600, of which 9 still to look into):

- **Fix:** a charge (auto plug-in, Charge now, the car plugged in sensor,
  or the charge before a saving session) joined to one of the automatic
  schedule's blocks ran on once that block was taken out (the automatic
  schedule off, or planning again): its own unplug ends it again, and it
  joins what's still there.
- **Fix:** saving sessions weren't put in again when the automatic schedule
  planned again if a charge from earlier in the day (already over) was in
  the schedule, so the charge before a session could be left joined to
  blocks that had gone.
- **Fix:** what a saving session (or its charge before) changed on the
  automatic schedule's blocks is redone when those blocks are taken out,
  rather than left (e.g. a block's later start with nothing to end it).
- **Fix:** moving a slot of yours that a charge had made start later (for
  the daily limit) left that later start in place, possibly after the
  slot's new end.
- **Fix:** the automatic schedule planning again while one of its blocks
  joined on to a charge was going took out the unplug ending it.
- **Fix:** deleting a slot on the page took an unplug that also ended
  another piece still in the schedule (e.g. a skipped piece of a slot moved
  for a saving session): it's kept.
- **Fix:** turning the automatic schedule off could leave one of your
  unplugs skipped by nothing (a skip it shared with a saving session).

## 2.96.0 — Schedule: nothing left plugged in

Found by a new set of random scenarios (tests/schedule_scenarios.py): your
slots, the automatic schedule, saving sessions, auto plug-in and Charge now
turned on and off, slots and blocks moved, skipped and deleted as the page
does, and time passing, checking after every step that nothing is left
plugged in with no end.

- **Fix:** turning the automatic schedule off (or it planning again) left a
  slot it had joined one of its blocks to with nothing to end it: what its
  blocks changed is now put back with them. The same for a saving session's
  changes, and the charge before one.
- **Fix:** auto plug-in or Charge now planned while the automatic schedule
  was on kept the automatic schedule's skips as its own, so turning the
  automatic schedule off left your slot running on (e.g. until the next
  day). A charge now only keeps the skips it makes itself.
- **Fix:** turning the automatic schedule off brought back an unplug of
  yours in the middle of a charge that had joined its block, ending the
  charge early: the charge runs to its own end.
- **Fix:** the charge before a saving session could be ended part way by
  an unplug of a slot whose plug-in was skipped (e.g. by the automatic
  schedule, then planned again): it's skipped while the charge runs.
- **Fix:** cancelling Charge now when it had joined another charge (or had
  been moved for a saving session) left that charge with no end.
- **Fix:** deleting one of two charges that end together on the page took
  the other's unplug too: it's kept.
- **Fix:** turning the schedule back on could join a charge to everything
  up to the next day (a charge whose own unplug was kept for the schedule
  off looked open-ended, as did a slot it had joined before).
- **Change:** pressing Charge now again replaces the one already in the
  schedule, rather than adding a second on top.

## 2.95.3 — Read only keeps the next slot sensors

- **Change:** with Read only on, the next slot sensors (for Predbat) keep the
  values they had when it was turned on (after a restart too), rather than
  following a schedule nothing is acting on. Turned off, they follow the
  schedule again.

## 2.95.2 — Automatic schedule: no slot left running on

- **Fix:** with the automatic schedule on, moving one of its blocks to start
  earlier (before now) could leave the car plugged in until the next day:
  it planned again while that block was going, taking out its unplug. It
  now waits for the block to end, as it does for one going as planned.
- **Fix:** where the automatic schedule cut one of your runs of slots short
  (e.g. 13:00-17:00 with your 15:00 slot inside it, cut to 13:00-13:30),
  the plug-in inside it (15:00) wasn't skipped, so it plugged back in with
  nothing to end it (over the daily limit until Wednesday). It's skipped
  with the time taken out now.

## 2.95.1 — Deleting the charge before a saving session

- **Fix:** deleting the charge before a saving session on the schedule left
  an unplug on its own (the end of the slot it had joined), kept the slot it
  joined or trimmed skipped, and its stripes stayed on whatever slot covered
  that time. What it changed is now put back, nothing is left behind, and
  it isn't added again for that session (unless the hours change).
- **Fix:** deleting part of a slot moved for a saving session no longer
  leaves its unplug at the session's start on its own.

## 2.95.0 — Populate schedule: update automatically

- **Feature:** Automations › Populate schedule has an on/off switch to
  **update the schedule automatically**: once a day from 12:00 (and when
  it's turned on or its settings change) the plan is worked out again and,
  if it's changed, made your schedule. It waits while a slot or charge is
  going; the card shows when it last ran and what it did.
- **Change:** busy half hours in your off-peak times move to the next
  busiest times again, so every slot is used (2.94.1 dropped them); the note
  says how much moved on which days.

## 2.94.1 — Populate schedule: off-peak times

- **Change:** half hours the plan picks in your off-peak times are dropped
  (with a note of how much on which days) rather than swapped for the next
  busiest times: the car charges in them anyway. Add to schedule keeps your
  off-peak times.

## 2.94.0 — Populate schedule: Add to schedule

- **Feature:** Automations › Populate schedule › **Add to schedule** (click
  twice to confirm) replaces all your slots with the plan. Charges from auto
  plug-in, Charge now and the car plugged in sensor stay and take the time
  they need from the new slots, from their start or end as Over the daily
  limit is set.
- **Fix:** the plan follows your supplier's limit day (Octopus: 12:00 to
  12:00) and never picks more than its daily limit, so it can't go over it
  overnight. With no supplier, days run midnight to midnight.
- **Fix:** energy sensors (kWh) are refused: pick a power sensor.
- **Improvement:** off-peak times are left out of the plan, as slots can't
  go in them.
- **Change:** Slots to calculate defaults to 12 (6 hours); the card asks for
  your house load sensor.
- **Docs:** Populate schedule.

## 2.93.0 — Over the daily limit: from the start or the end

- **Feature:** Automations › Auto plug-in › **Over the daily limit**: when a
  charge (auto plug-in, Charge now or the car plugged in sensor) takes a day
  over your supplier's daily limit, the time comes off the **start of the
  next slot** (it starts later, as before) or its **end** (it ends
  earlier). E.g. Octopus, 18:00–23:00 tonight and 3 hours from 14:00: it
  starts at 20:00, or ends at 21:00.
- **Fix:** Populate schedule put the weeks from before the clocks changed
  an hour out (e.g. an 18:00 peak in October's British Summer Time counted
  as 17:00), blurring the plan. It now works in Home Assistant's time zone.
- **Fix:** Populate schedule's weeks and slots took true/false as 1, and
  2.5 as 2; they're refused now.

## 2.92.2 — Populate schedule plan display

- **Change:** **Automations › Populate schedule** plan shows each window's average power inline (e.g. `Mon 07:30–08:00 (0.6 kW), 15:30–20:30 (0.9 kW)`).

## 2.92.1 — Populate schedule fixes and improvements

- **Fix:** registered the `/api/automation/populate_plan` endpoint (the plan could fail with “Couldn’t calculate the plan: HTTP 404”).
- **Improvement:** tighter history fetching (hourly stats only fill the leading gap before 5-minute stats), clearer notes when history is estimated from raw data or the power unit was assumed, and internal planner cleanups.
- **Docs:** clarified that the **charger/EV charging power** sensor should be selected (highest average = when it usually charged).
- **Change:** added unit tests for the populate-schedule planner (weekday isolation, top slots, merging, scaling).

## 2.92.0 — Populate schedule plan

- **Feature:** **Automations › Populate schedule** now calculates a **Plan** from the selected power sensor's history. Set **Slots to calculate** (best 30-minute slots per day) alongside **Weeks previous**; the plan recalculates when any of the three change. Each weekday uses only that weekday's history (e.g. Mondays from Mondays), picks the highest-average-power slots, merges adjacent slots, and shows a compact per-day plan. **Add to schedule** is present but does nothing for now.

## 2.91.0 — Populate schedule settings

- **Feature:** **Automations › Populate schedule**: choose a power sensor
  and set **Weeks previous** (how many weeks of history to look back
  over). Settings only for now; the populate action will be added later.

## 2.90.2 — Read only turns the title bar orange

- **Change:** while read only is on, the whole title bar (with the tabs)
  turns orange, so it's clear something's different, and the **Turn off**
  button is white so it stands out from the bar.

## 2.90.1 — Read only in the title bar

- **Change:** the read only banner is now a compact orange **Read only**
  pill next to the add-on's name in the title bar, with a **Turn off**
  button, so it takes up far less of the screen. The title bar stays at the
  top as you scroll, so it's always in view.

## 2.90.0 — Read only banner

- **Feature:** while **Settings › Read only** is on, a large orange banner
  across the top of every tab says so, with a **Turn off read only** button.
- **Fix:** the **Read only** chip on the Overview only showed once you'd
  been to Automations, Settings or Diagnostics; the page now reads the
  setting on every tab.

## 2.89.0 — Six next slot sensors for Predbat

- **Feature:** the next slot sensors now cover the schedule's next six slots
  (was three): `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_next_slot_4_...`,
  `..._next_slot_5_...` and `..._next_slot_6_...` (date, start time and end
  time each) join the first three. Add them to Predbat's
  `rates_import_override` as you did the others.
- **Docs:** the Predbat section's `apps.yaml` example has all six.

## 2.88.3 — A slot straight before a high export counts as its charge

- **Fix:** with a discharge time needed, how full the battery starts a high
  export run only counted the automatic schedule's own charge before it, so
  a slot of yours (or Charge now, auto plug-in...) right before the run was
  taken as an empty battery, and the run got a top-up it didn't need. Any
  charging straight before the run now counts.
- **Fix:** true/false sent for Charge time needed, Discharge time needed or
  High export half hours a day was taken as 1; it's refused now.

## 2.88.2 — Charge and discharge time fixes

- **Fix:** planning again during a high export run (e.g. when tomorrow's
  rates come at about 16:00, in the middle of the evening peak) dropped its
  top-ups still to come. A run under way now keeps them, working out how
  full the battery is from what's been charged before and in it.
- **Fix:** with a discharge time needed, the charge before (and after) a high
  export run was as long as the run, whatever the charge and discharge times:
  e.g. an hour's run with a 2-hour full charge and a 1-hour discharge got an
  hour's charge (half full) and a top-up in the run. It's now as long as it
  takes to charge for the run (at most a full charge): 2 hours there, and
  half an hour with a 1-hour charge and 2-hour discharge.
- **Fix:** the three Before the high exports settings no longer show for a
  moment when the page opens with Where exporting pays least.
- **Docs:** Charge time needed's note says what empty means with a discharge
  time (the same as it).

## 2.88.1 — Before the high exports' settings only with it

- **Improvement:** Charge time needed, Discharge time needed and High export
  half hours a day show only with Charge: Before the high exports (their
  values are kept). With Where exporting pays least, no high export half
  hours are marked on the schedule or listed in the plan.

## 2.88.0 — Top-ups inside a high export longer than the battery lasts

- **Feature:** Discharge time needed (how long a full battery exports for) is
  now used: with Charge: Before the high exports, a high export run longer
  than it gets top-up charging inside it, so the battery cycles and exports
  more of the run. How many: the part the battery can't cover, shared between
  charging and exporting as charge time : discharge time, rounded up. Where:
  every placement is tried, following the battery's charge through the run,
  and the one exporting the most is kept (a joined-up top-up preferred when
  it's as good). The battery starts the run as full as its charge before made
  it. Top-ups count towards the daily limit (the dearest runs first), are
  drawn as charging (no high export mark under them), and the Notes say e.g.
  "Top-up 17:00–17:30 inside the Tue 16:00–19:00 high export".

## 2.87.2 — High export marks back under the schedule

- **Change:** 2.87.1 undone: the orange high export marks along the bottom of
  each day (and their legend entry) are back.

## 2.87.1 — No high export marks under the schedule

- **Change:** the orange high export marks along the bottom of each day are
  gone (and their legend entry), leaving the export rates line along the
  top. The high export half hours are still used by Before the high exports
  and listed in the plan.

## 2.87.0 — Charge time needed and discharge time needed

- **Feature:** Automations › Automatic schedule › Charge time needed (hours,
  in half hours): with Charge: Before the high exports, the most each charge
  before, and after, a high export run is. E.g. a 2-hour run with an hour
  needed: an hour before it, the run, an hour after it, and the rest of the
  charging half hours at the cheapest. Empty: as long as the run (as
  before). It plans again when it's changed.
- **Feature:** Discharge time needed (hours): saved, but not used yet (for a
  later version).

## 2.86.0 — Before the high exports: a charge after them too

- **Change:** Charge: Before the high exports now charges straight after each
  run of high export half hours too, as long as the run (up to the next run),
  once each has its charge before it; only then does the rest go where
  exporting pays least. E.g. an hour of high export and 12 half hours of
  charging: an hour before it, a pause for it, an hour after it, and the
  other 8 half hours at the cheapest.

## 2.85.0 — Tomorrow planned on an estimate until its rates are out

- **Feature:** until tomorrow's export rates are out (Octopus: about 16:00),
  the automatic schedule plans tomorrow on an estimate: each half hour at
  the day before's rate, as if known. So the limit day from 12:00 today can
  charge tomorrow morning when that's cheaper, and your slots there give way
  as they do on a known day. It plans again on the real rates when they
  come. The Notes say from when the plan's on an estimate.
- **Improvement:** the estimated export rates and high export marks are on
  the schedule too, faded (hover: "an estimate"); the high export half hours
  include tomorrow's estimated ones (for Charge: Before the high exports).

## 2.84.0 — Before the high exports uses all the charging half hours

- **Change:** with Charge: Before the high exports, all the charging half
  hours a day are now used: first straight before each run of the high
  export half hours (as before), then the rest where exporting pays least
  (never in a high export half hour). E.g. 4 high and 12 of charging: 4
  before the high exports and 8 at the cheapest, where before only the 4
  were planned. With no high export half hours marked, it all goes where
  exporting pays least.

## 2.83.2 — Local time in the hours the clocks change

- **Fix:** 2.83.1's local time for the rates was still an hour out within
  the hour the clocks change itself: the hour that happens twice when they go
  back (its second time), and the half hours either side of the hour they
  skip going forward. Every half hour around both changes is now checked.

## 2.83.1 — Automatic schedule: review fixes and tidy-up

- **Fix:** around the clocks changing, rates for after the change (they come
  in UTC) were put an hour out, as local time used the offset of now: e.g.
  the evening before the clocks go back, Sunday's cheapest 13:00–14:00 was
  planned 14:00–15:00. Saving sessions after a change had the same slip.
- **Fix:** Before the high exports: after a restart in the morning, the
  limit day from 12:00 yesterday had no high half hours marked (its
  afternoon unseen), so the charges before the rest of them were dropped
  until 12:00. The rates seen are now kept over a restart.
- **Fix:** Before the high exports: during a high export run, a note said
  its charge "didn't fit"; a run under way is now passed over quietly.
- **Fix:** turning on Force schedule on supplier, or changing the export rates
  to Predbat's, now plans again (e.g. so a long block is split at the
  limit's reset). It no longer plans again each half hour during a high
  export run in Before mode.
- **Fix:** the page's "known until" and the schedule's automatic colour now
  stop where the rates are really known, not into a Predbat copy of the day
  before or a day at one price; the export rates and high marks on the page
  now cut such days at midnight local time.
- **Fix:** the Automations page could show an older plan when refreshes
  overlapped; only the latest is drawn now.
- **Change:** the planner's code tidied (one shared way of taking a half hour
  for both modes, unused helpers and arguments removed); no change to how
  it plans.

## 2.83.0 — Charge before the high export times, or where exporting pays least

- **Feature:** Automations › Automatic schedule › Charge: Where exporting
  pays least (as before) or Before the high exports: each run of the high
  export half hours gets a charge straight before it, as long as the run
  (e.g. high exports 16:00–19:00, charging 13:00–16:00), in free half hours,
  not past the run before or now, the dearest runs first, up to the charging
  half hours a day and the daily limit. It plans again when you switch.
- **Fix:** the summaries on the Automations, Settings and Diagnostics lists
  (2.80.0) stopped updating: the folded Schedule settings line had none, and
  the rest were skipped after it. Some summaries also lost their tidying up
  (e.g. Daily limit: "6 hours a day (automatic) · resets every day at
  12:00").

## 2.82.0 — High export half hours, set separately from the charging

- **Feature:** Automations › Automatic schedule has two numbers: Charging
  half hours a day (as before: planned where exporting pays least) and High
  export half hours a day (new, 0 for none): each limit day's highest export
  rates, marked in orange along the bottom of each day on the schedule, with
  a High export entry in the legend and the plan. Marked only: the charging
  isn't kept out of them. Shown whether the automatic schedule is on or off.
- **Improvement:** the export rates seen are remembered for 2 days, so the
  limit day from 12:00 yesterday is judged on its afternoon too; a day whose
  start hasn't been seen (just after a restart in the morning) isn't marked.
- **Improvement:** the plan log has a High exports (marked) line.

## 2.81.1 — Export rates shown straight away after a refresh

- **Fix:** with Show export rates on the schedule on, the rates now show as
  soon as the Automations page opens or is refreshed. Before, the schedule
  was drawn before the setting had loaded, so they only appeared up to 10
  seconds later (the setting itself was saved).

## 2.81.0 — Export rates on the schedule; charging where exporting pays least

- **Feature:** Automations › Automatic schedule › Show export rates on the
  schedule: each half hour's export rate as a coloured line along the top of
  each day, green where it's lowest and red where it's highest, with the
  range in the legend (hover for the price). Its own switch, shown whether
  the automatic schedule is on or off. It replaces the orange best export
  marks.
- **Change:** the automatic schedule no longer picks and keeps clear the
  best export times: each day's half hours of charging simply go where
  exporting pays least (still not in an off-peak time or a saving session,
  and with auto plug-in, Charge now, the car plugged in sensor and the charge
  before a saving session coming first). The plan's Best export row and the
  log's Best exports line are gone. It plans again after the update.
- **Fix:** a Charge now (or auto plug-in) while one of its blocks is going no
  longer brings back your slots it had skipped for the rest of the day until
  that block ends, which could take the day over its limit.

## 2.80.0 — Automations, Settings and Diagnostics as lists

- **Improvement:** the Automations, Settings and Diagnostics tabs are now
  lists: each card is a row with an icon, its title and a one-line summary
  kept up to date (e.g. "Armed · plugs in when it drops below 30% · now
  64%"), with its switch to hand. Click a row to open its settings in place.
  Which rows are open is remembered on each device; they start folded.
- **Improvement:** Automations: the schedule's own settings (random start
  delay, Force schedule on supplier, wait at unplug, the plan check) fold
  into the schedule card under a one-line summary, in place of their own
  card. Diagnostics › Debug: the logs stay as they are, with the tools as a
  list under them.

## 2.79.2 — The automatic schedule's plan folds away

- **Improvement:** the plan in the Automatic schedule card folds away, with a
  one-line summary (e.g. "Plan: 4h of charging to come, 2 of your slots
  changed"; while it's off, "Plan if it were on: ..."). Click it to see the
  whole plan. Open or folded is remembered on each device (folded at first).

## 2.79.1 — Long automatic blocks split at the limit's reset

- **Fix:** a block of the automatic schedule (on its own, or joined to one
  of your slots) longer than your supplier's daily limit across its reset
  time (Octopus: 12:00) is now split there, as your own slots are: it
  unplugs and plugs straight back in, so the supplier sees a charge either
  side, each with its own ready time. Before, e.g. 09:00–15:30 was one
  charge with a 15:30 ready time. Blocks within the limit stay one charge.

## 2.79.0 — See the automatic schedule's plan while it's off

- **Feature:** while the automatic schedule is off, its card shows what it
  would do if it were turned on: the charging it would add, which of your
  slots would be skipped or shortened, the best export and off-peak times.
  It's worked out on the schedule as it is (nothing changes, nothing is
  logged) and again when the rates, the schedule or the half hour change.
  The rates are read while it's off too.
- **Improvement:** the card's new Your slots row lists the slots that gave
  way (on or off), in place of that note.
- **Fix:** tomorrow's rates are used even when they're the same as today's
  (e.g. a tariff with the same times each day), so the charging isn't all
  put into this evening. Only Predbat's rates have a day that's a copy of
  the day before left out (its guess at rates not published yet); a
  supplier's own next day rates (e.g. Octopus Energy's) are real.
- **Fix:** un-skipping a slot the automatic schedule had skipped now sticks.
  Before, once the slot had started, planning again brought back its
  plug-in skip (as one of the skips it had made before now), so the slot
  showed as skipped while it charged. It's now yours: not skipped by it
  again, and the plan is worked out again around it straight away.
- **Change:** turning the automatic schedule on no longer asks how many half
  hours: it uses the number set in its card.
- **Change:** ending a charging session with the unplug button or switch now
  asks once, inline (End the session / Cancel), rather than needing a second
  press.

## 2.78.7 — Best export times from the whole day again

- **Change:** a day's best export half hours are picked from the whole limit
  day again (as in 2.78.2), so late in the day what's left isn't all marked
  as best (e.g. at 21:30 with 4 asked for and the best 4 gone, none is, and
  the charging takes 22:00–00:00). The rule from 2.78.4 stays: never so many
  that the day's charging has nowhere to go.
- **Improvement:** it remembers the export prices it's seen, so in the
  morning the limit day from 12:00 yesterday still has yesterday
  afternoon's prices (the Octopus integration only has today's then), and
  tomorrow morning's count once they're out at about 16:00.
- **Change:** planned again straight after updating.

## 2.78.6 — The automatic schedule's plan in the log

- **Improvement:** each time the automatic schedule plans, the add-on's log
  has a summary of the plan: its charging, the best export times, the
  off-peak times from your import rates, its notes (your slots that gave
  way, charging it couldn't place), what comes first (auto plug-in, Charge
  now, the car plugged in sensor, the charge before a saving session), the
  whole plugged-in schedule from now, and each limit day's total against
  your supplier's limit (e.g. "Tue 12:00–Wed 12:00: 6h of 6h", with OVER
  when it's over). Handy when something looks wrong.

## 2.78.5 — Planned again straight after updating

- **Change:** a plan from 2.78.4 or earlier is made again straight after
  updating (not at the next change), so the latest fixes apply at once.

## 2.78.4 — Best export times from what's left of the day

- **Change:** a day's best export half hours are picked from those still to
  come again (not the whole day, as 2.78.2 did), but never so many that
  there's nowhere left for the charging the day still needs within its
  limit: then the lowest of them aren't marked, and the charging goes there
  (e.g. with 12 asked for at 12:25, 20:30 at 19.93p isn't marked, so all 12
  half hours of charging fit). With the day's limit reached, they're all
  marked.

## 2.78.3 — Both limit days under each date; the automatic schedule's settings always shown

- **Change:** under each date, the charging scheduled in the limit day ending
  at that day's reset / the one starting then, e.g. **5½h / 6h** under
  Tuesday for Octopus (Monday 12:00 to Tuesday 12:00, then Tuesday 12:00 to
  Wednesday 12:00); each in red when it's over the daily limit, hover for
  the times. Without a reset time, the day's.
- **Change:** the Automatic schedule card shows its settings (half hours,
  rates) when it's off too.

## 2.78.2 — An auto plug-in keeps what the automatic schedule has done

- **Fix:** an auto plug-in, Charge now or the car plugged in sensor took out
  everything the automatic schedule had changed, including what had already
  been: your slots it had skipped earlier came back (counted as if they'd
  run) and its earlier charging was forgotten, so a day's total was wrong.
  Now only its changes still to come are taken out (a block that's going
  carries on to its end), and it's planned again around the charge.
- **Change:** a day's best export half hours are picked from the whole day,
  so late in the day what's left isn't all marked as best; and a charge that
  comes first counts among them where its price is one of the best (it's
  charging then), as the charge before a saving session already did.

## 2.78.1 — Slots a saving session shortened give way too

- **Fix:** a slot of yours that the charge before a saving session had
  shortened (to keep within the daily limit) stayed in the plan, e.g. a
  19:30–20:00 left in the best export times, when the automatic schedule was
  turned on after that charge had started. It now gives way like your other
  slots; only the charge before the session itself is kept.
- **Fix:** your part of a slot joined to the charge before a saving session
  gives way where the rates are known (the charge keeps its time), and a slot
  only counts as joined to Charge now, auto plug-in or the car plugged in
  sensor when that charge starts in it, not every slot after one.

## 2.78.0 — The automatic schedule: best exports kept clear, charging where exporting pays least

- **Change:** the automatic schedule plans differently. Each day whose export
  rates are known, its X best export half hours are marked (orange) and kept
  clear, and X half hours of charging go in the free half hours where
  exporting pays least, before or after them (e.g. 23:00 at 16.40p rather
  than 19:30 at 21.95p). It no longer charges straight before each run of
  exports.
- **Change:** your slots give way wherever the export rates are known
  (skipped or shortened), not only to keep within the daily limit; they stay
  where rates aren't known yet (e.g. tomorrow morning before 16:00), and come
  back when it's turned off.
- **Change:** auto plug-in, the car plugged in sensor, Charge now and saving
  sessions take from its half hours only where the day would otherwise go
  over your supplier's daily limit. Its own charging earlier in the day still
  counts towards them.
- **Fix:** planned again, your slots give way before the saving sessions
  still to come go in again, so a session only moves what's left of yours
  (or adds its own charge before it), and a slot Charge now has joined keeps
  its end.
- **Change:** a plan from an older version is made again after updating.

## 2.77.0 — Your slots out of the best export times, and saving sessions first

- **Feature:** with the automatic schedule, the half hours of your slots that
  are in the day's best export times move to the free half hours that day
  where exporting pays least, so charging doesn't take from the exports
  (e.g. your 19:00–20:00 with 19:00–20:00 among the best goes to 22:00–22:30
  and 23:00–23:30). The time's the same, so the day's limit is kept; the
  Notes say what moved.
- **Fix:** a saving session found after the automatic schedule had skipped a
  slot could have that slot put back inside the session when it planned
  again. Saving sessions still to come are now put in on your own schedule
  first each time, and it plans around them; a skip both need stays until
  neither does.
- **Fix:** time it moved isn't changed while it's going (as for its blocks).
- **Change:** a slot the automatic schedule joins its charging on to, in the
  days it's planned (cyan), is drawn as one block again (e.g. 19:00–20:30),
  not your slot and a lighter piece; past those days the lighter piece stays.
- **Change:** a plan from an older version is made again after updating.

## 2.76.3 — Remove the time over just for that day

- **Feature:** a weekly slot over the daily limit on a day now offers
  **Remove the … over (just this one)** as well as **(every week)**: just
  that day is shortened to fit (it's skipped that day, and the shorter time
  added for it as a one-off); the other weeks keep their times.

## 2.76.2 — A slot drawn for its own time

- **Fix:** a slot the automatic schedule joins its charging on to (e.g. your
  19:00–20:00 carried on to 20:30) is drawn for its own time, 19:00–20:00,
  with the automatic schedule's 20:00–20:30 as its own lighter piece after
  it, not drawn to 20:30 underneath it. Dragging the slot or its ends works
  from its own times too.

## 2.76.1 — The automatic schedule's part of a slot shown

- **Fix:** where the automatic schedule joins its charging on to one of your
  slots (e.g. 19:00–20:00 carried on to 20:30), the part it added wasn't
  drawn (since 2.73.4, with your slot in its colour too): it's now a lighter
  cyan piece, set apart where it joins.
- **Improvement:** opening such a slot says so: when it's plugged in that
  day, what the automatic schedule added, and that the times in the editor
  are your slot's own.

## 2.76.0 — The week on a phone, and the automatic schedule's plan kept straight

- **Feature:** on a phone the week scrolls sideways, so a day has room rather
  than being squashed into the screen. It opens at now, and the days stay on
  the left as it scrolls. Swipe to scroll, tap to open or add a slot, and
  press and hold a slot, then drag, to move it (it scrolls along at the
  edges); the ends still drag to change its times.
- **Fix:** the charge before a saving session no longer keeps its half hours
  out of the best export times: where their export price is one of the day's
  best they count (and are marked orange), so the rest of the X aren't made
  up with lower prices (e.g. 16:30–17:30 at 31p counted, not 20:00 and 21:30
  at 19.5p).
- **Fix:** planned again (e.g. when tomorrow's rates come out), what it had
  already done is kept: its blocks that have been and the time it took off
  your slots earlier count in the day, so the day can't get more than its
  limit, and a slot it trimmed earlier isn't put back as if it had run.
- **Fix:** a block joined on where two charges end at the same time (e.g. a
  Charge now and a slot both ending at 16:00) skips both unplugs, so it isn't
  unplugged as it starts.
- **Change:** a plan made by an older version is made again after updating.

## 2.75.2 — Week rows evenly spaced

- **Fix:** the day labels on the week (day, date and charging) are slightly
  smaller, so they fit the row's height and there's no extra gap between days.

## 2.75.1 — Automatic schedule after a restart or update

- **Fix:** just after the add-on starts, your slots up to the end of the
  rates (e.g. all of tomorrow) were drawn in the automatic schedule's cyan
  until your supplier's details loaded: it now keeps to the limit day it
  planned (e.g. to 12:00 tomorrow) throughout.
- **Fix:** after a start, the automatic schedule waits (up to 3 minutes) for
  your supplier's integration, so it never plans without its daily limit.
- **Fix:** it plans again when the daily limit or its reset time changes, and
  after an update that changes how it plans (a plan from 2.74.0 or earlier
  didn't count a saving session as one of the best exports, so it had no
  orange best-export line, until something else changed).

## 2.75.0 — Each day's charging under its date

- **Feature:** the week shows, under each date, the charging scheduled from
  the limit reset that day to the next (e.g. 12:00 today to 12:00 tomorrow
  for Octopus: that afternoon and the next morning; midnight to midnight
  without a reset time) and the daily limit, e.g. **5h / 6h**, in red when
  it's over. Hover for the window and your supplier's limit. Counts every
  slot that will plug in: yours, the automatic schedule's, Charge now and
  the rest.

## 2.74.1 — Saving sessions count as best exports

- **Fix:** with the automatic schedule, a saving session's half hours now
  count as ones of the day's best export half hours (the X you asked for),
  whatever the export price then, rather than only if their price made the
  cut. Its charge before it is its charge, so the rest of the X go to the
  next best export times (e.g. a 1-hour session with 12 half hours asked for:
  10 more). Without a charge before it, it's charged for first, like any run.

## 2.74.0 — Drag and drop slots

- **Feature:** drag a slot on the week by its middle to move it to another
  time or day, in half hours. A one-off moves; a weekly slot asks **Every
  week** (the series moves; dragged to another day, that weekday moves with
  it) or **Just this one** (that day's skipped and a one-off added at the new
  time). The usual checks apply (overlaps, daily limit, ready times). Slots
  already started, skipped, turned off or the automatic schedule's own blocks
  don't drag; a tap still opens the slot and the ends still resize it.

## 2.73.4 — The automatic schedule's plan, all in cyan

- **Change:** with the automatic schedule on, your slots still to come up to
  the end of the last limit day it has planned (e.g. 12:00 tomorrow for
  Octopus) are cyan too, with its own blocks: that's the plan it's made.
  Charge now, auto plug-in, the car plugged in sensor and saving sessions keep
  their own colours, and slots after that day keep theirs.

## 2.73.3 — The automatic schedule in cyan

- **Change:** the automatic schedule's charging is cyan (a greener cyan than
  your weekly slots' blue).

## 2.73.2 — The automatic schedule's own colour

- **Change:** the automatic schedule's charging is olive (lime in dark mode),
  a colour nothing else on the page uses: green is what's charged.

## 2.73.1 — Schedule colours

- **Change:** the automatic schedule's charging shows green even where it
  overlaps or joins one of your slots (drawn on top of it).
- **Change:** the charge before a saving session is striped purple, also where
  one of your slots covers that time.

## 2.73.0 — Automatic schedule: your slots keep the times worth least to export

- **Change:** where your slots give way for the daily limit, the time comes off
  half an hour at a time where export pays most, not a whole slot at a time:
  e.g. 22:00–22:30 (19p) is kept rather than 15:30–16:00 (23p). A half hour
  whose export price isn't known yet counts as least, so it's kept.

## 2.72.3 — Automations tab: cards stay put

- **Fix:** turning the automatic schedule (or another card's options) on or off
  moved the Automations tab's cards between its two columns. Each card now has
  its own column: Auto plug-in, Car plugged in and Auto re-plug on the left,
  Saving sessions and Automatic schedule on the right (one column on a phone).

## 2.72.2 — Automatic schedule: your slots give way only for what it places

- **Fix:** your slots in a limit day all gave way when the automatic schedule
  couldn't place all the half hours asked for (e.g. 12 asked for, 6 placed
  this late in the day): they give way only for the blocks it places now,
  those in its best export times first.

## 2.72.1 — Automatic schedule: bugs found by randomised testing

Found by checking thousands of random schedules (your slots, skips, off-peak
times, saving sessions with and without the charge before, Charge now, auto
plug-in and the car plugged in sensor), limits of 2 to 8 hours or none, resets
at 00:00, 04:00, 12:00 and 17:00 or rolling 24 / 48 hours, and over a day and
a half with tomorrow's rates arriving at 16:00:

- **Fix:** a rolling limit (EDF Energy, E.ON Next: any 24 or 48 hours) wasn't
  kept to: blocks only go where no 24 (or 48) hours they're in goes over now.
- **Fix:** where a limit day couldn't fit after a few tries, its blocks were
  shown as planned but left out of the schedule.
- **Fix:** a slot of yours joined by a charge that comes first (e.g. Charge
  now) could be "trimmed" as if it ran to your next unplug, leaving the car
  plugged in overnight.
- **Fix:** an unplug time on its own inside a block (e.g. a slot's unplug whose
  plug-in is skipped) cut the block short: it's skipped while the block runs.
- **Fix:** with no limit known, half hours were counted by calendar day rather
  than from the reset time.

## 2.72.0 — Read only mode

- **Feature:** **Settings › Read only**: nothing plugs in or unplugs by itself
  and your supplier's ready time isn't changed, but everything's still planned
  and shown (and what it would have done is logged), so you can watch what it
  would do. Plugging in and unplugging by hand (the page, the Plugged In
  helper, Charge now) still works. A Read only chip shows while it's on.

## 2.71.2 — Automatic schedule: the daily limit by limit day, always

- **Fix:** charging before an export that starts at the limit's reset (e.g.
  12:00–18:00) could take the limit day before (12:00 to 12:00) over its 6
  hours. The limit now always applies to the automatic schedule by limit day,
  whether or not Force schedule on supplier is on.
- **Change:** each limit day's hours go to the exports most worth it first,
  wherever they are (an export run the charging for a better one runs over
  isn't exported in). The Notes say when a run got less because its day's
  hours went to better exports.

## 2.71.1 — Automatic schedule: not planned on placeholder rates

- **Fix:** a day whose export rates are all one price isn't planned on.
  Before tomorrow's Agile Outgoing rates are out (about 16:00), Octopus
  Energy's integration has the fixed export rate for it, so the earliest half
  hours tomorrow were picked as "best". It's planned when the real rates come.

## 2.71.0 — Automatic schedule: the best exports, charged for straight before

- **Change:** the half hours asked for are your best export times of the day,
  and each run of them is charged for straight before it, as far as there's
  time, not scattered between the exports: with the best 12 at 15:00–20:00
  and 20:30–21:30, charging 10:00–15:00 and 20:00–20:30 (Notes say when
  there wasn't enough time).
- **Change:** its share of each day is kept for it, even what it can't place
  until the rest of the rates are out (e.g. tomorrow's at 16:00), so your
  slots in that day give way, those in its best export times first.
- **Fix:** a day that's a copy of the day before (Predbat's guess before the
  real rates are published) isn't planned on.
- **Fix:** the charge before a saving session comes first, however it's
  covered: no automatic block or export is planned in it, and it isn't
  trimmed for the daily limit. Exports during the session itself still count.
- **Change:** a slot moved for a saving session shows as your slot, with the
  time it's moved to (outside its own) in purple.

## 2.70.1 — Automatic schedule: within the daily limit, per day

- **Fix:** the automatic schedule could take a day over your supplier's daily
  limit: it didn't take time from your slots its blocks joined, ran inside or
  sat between. It now does (on the side away from the block), and if a day
  still can't fit, plans fewer blocks there, so it never goes over.
- **Change:** the half hours asked for are a day's (your supplier's limit
  day, e.g. 12:00 to 12:00), for every day the rates are known: 12 for
  Octopus gives each day's 6 hours to the best times, in place of your slots.

## 2.70.0 — Automatic schedule

- **Feature:** **Automations › Automatic schedule** plans charging from your
  import and export rates: the half hours you ask for (asked when you turn it
  on) go straight before the best export prices, matching each run of them,
  and the cheapest import times become off-peak times. Its blocks are added
  as one-offs (green), as a charge before a saving session is, taking time
  off your own slots in a day that would go over the daily limit.
- **Feature:** auto plug-in, the car plugged in sensor, Charge now and a
  charge before a saving session come first: the automatic blocks are taken
  out for them and planned again around them.
- **Feature:** rates are found automatically from Octopus Energy's and EDF
  Energy's integrations, else Predbat's (e.g. for E.ON Next), or picked
  (`rates_prefix` and `rates_adjusted_field` in `suppliers.json`).
- **Docs:** the Automatic schedule section.

## 2.69.0 — Next slot sensors move on early

- **Feature:** **Settings › Next slot sensors › Move on early**: each slot
  drops off the next slot sensors this many minutes before it starts (5 to
  start with; 0: when it starts), so Predbat can replan in case the slot
  doesn't go ahead.

## 2.68.1 — Add a weekly slot where it fits the daily limit

- **Feature:** a new or changed weekly slot that would take a day over your
  supplier's daily limit (e.g. today, already at 6 hours) now offers **Save,
  skipping it today** (or on the days it would go over) beside **Save
  anyway**: it runs on its other days, and isn't added over the limit.

## 2.68.0 — Add a weekly slot where it doesn't overlap

- **Feature:** a new or changed weekly slot that overlaps another slot on
  some days (e.g. a one-off you already have today) can be saved anyway,
  skipped on those days: **Save, skipping it today** (or on the days it
  overlaps). It runs on all its other days, and **Undo skip** puts a day back.
  The skips are saved with the slot, so the daily limit is checked with them.

## 2.67.3 — Next slots: just listed in Diagnostics

- **Change:** Diagnostics › Home Assistant entities lists the next slots
  sensors with the others, without their readings or the Predbat set-up (the
  `apps.yaml` lines are in the documentation).

## 2.67.2 — Predbat: the next slots always on

- **Change:** the next slots sensors are always published, and the Settings
  tab's Predbat card is gone. They're shown in **Diagnostics › Home Assistant
  entities**, with **Set up Predbat** (the `apps.yaml` lines to copy).

## 2.67.1 — Predbat: the rate is set in Predbat

- **Change:** the slot rate setting and `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_slot_rate`
  are gone: put your off-peak rate in Predbat's `apps.yaml` instead
  (`rate: 7`, say). The **Set up Predbat** lines show where.

## 2.67.0 — Tell Predbat the next slots

- **Feature:** **Settings › Predbat** can publish the schedule's next three
  slots as sensors (date, start and end each, as Octopus Charge Pack's), plus
  the rate to give them, for Predbat's `rates_import_override`. Predbat can
  then plan around a slot's cheap rate before your supplier has planned it.
  A slot drops off when it starts, or when the add-on plugs in for it, so
  from then on Predbat goes by your supplier's own slots. It doesn't depend
  on any supplier. Off by default.
- **Docs:** the Predbat section, with the `apps.yaml` to add (also on the
  card to copy).

## 2.66.7 — Schedule fixes from testing

- **Fix:** skipping a one-off slot (for example part of a saving session)
  no longer leaves a lone "unplug" marker on top of it, so **Undo skip** can
  be reached again.
- **Fix:** short pieces of a slot (such as 23:30–24:00 before midnight) can
  be tapped to open them; the resize handles used to cover them.
- **Fix:** a slot that overlaps another is refused with an explanation. The
  page used to draw the two as one long slot, but the car unplugs at the
  first slot's end, ending both. Slots that meet end to start are still one
  charge.
- **Fix:** putting a skipped slot back when another day is already over the
  daily limit now offers **Put it back anyway**, instead of a message that
  disappeared.

## 2.66.6 — Deleting a slot from a series

- **Fix:** deleting a slot that's part of a series now asks: **Every
  <weekday>** (just that day of the series), **All its days**, or **Just this
  one**. Before, with that day already skipped (e.g. by a saving session),
  the only choice was "Every week", which deleted the series on every day
- **Fix:** a one-off slot (moved for a saving session, Charge now...) that
  ended with a series' every-day unplug lost its end when the series was
  deleted, a day unticked or its time changed, so it stayed plugged in for
  days (a long "filler" slot, and hours over the daily limit). It now gets
  its own unplug at the same time
- **Fix:** "Just this one" always skips it (it shared a button with Skip this
  one, which puts back one that's already skipped)
- **Improvement:** Today, Tomorrow and Yesterday show their weekday too (the
  slot editor's days are Mo-Su)

## 2.66.5 — Changing a moved slot's end

- **Fix:** a one-off slot that ends with an every-day unplug (a slot moved
  for a saving session, or by Charge now or auto plug-in, e.g. 16:00 to your
  21:30): dragging its end (or changing it in the slot editor) added an
  unplug at the new time but left that day's 21:30, so it still unplugged at
  21:30 and the new time showed as an unplug on its own. That day's 21:30 is
  now skipped (only that day, and not if another slot that day ends with it).
  Deleting such a slot skips it too, so it doesn't leave an unplug behind

## 2.66.4 — Charge before a morning session, within the right day

- **Fix:** with a daily limit that resets at a time (Octopus: 12:00), a
  charge before a saving session that took a day over the limit was taken
  off the next slot after the session, even when that slot was in the next
  limit day (a 06:00 session: the afternoon's slot started later, though the
  charge counted in the day before). Now it comes off a slot in the same
  limit day: first the end of the one before the session (the evening
  before ends earlier, if that's still to come), then the start of the one
  after it, if that's still in the day. If there's nothing left in that day
  to take it off, the charge isn't added, and the session says why (in
  orange, Automations › Saving sessions, and in the log). A limit over any
  24 hours works as before

## 2.66.3 — Every supplier checked

- **Fix:** with E.ON Next (it has no ready time), with no supplier found, or
  when your supplier accepts no ready time before the unplug, setting the
  ready time is no longer tried again 8 times (with a warning each time) at
  every plug-in: that can't help. A failure that may pass (Home Assistant
  busy, an entity not there yet, no supplier looked for yet) is still tried
  again
- **Fix:** the page said the add-on's version from when it was first opened
  (2.66.1's page caching): it follows the version again (the build's
  test_the_page_and_the_api_say_the_version)
- **Improvement:** new tests run the same scenarios with Octopus Energy, EDF
  Energy, E.ON Next, an unlisted supplier and none: how each is found, its
  daily limit and reset (and one set on the Settings tab), the ready times it
  accepts, the schedule's checks, slots that meet, an 8 hour charge and
  setting the ready time

## 2.66.2 — Old upgrade handling removed

- **Change:** removed handling for versions long gone (every install is past
  them, including the ocpp_charge_proxy repository's 2.54.3):
  - saving sessions moved by versions before 2.43.7 are no longer moved again
  - chart files left by versions before 2.3.0 are no longer looked for and
    deleted
  - the old companion integration (0.x / 1.x) is no longer checked for
- Kept: a daily-limit reset saved as "48h" by 2.31.0 still reads as rolling,
  and a car plugged in with no plugged-in record still gets one

## 2.66.1 — Tidy up

- **Improvement:** the code is compiled when the image is built, so the first
  start after an update is quicker
- **Improvement:** the web page is read from disk once (again only if it
  changes) rather than every time it's opened
- **Improvement:** each message from your supplier is checked against the
  ones the add-on answers with a list worked out once, and replies to the
  add-on's own messages aren't read twice
- **Change:** removed page styles nothing used any more, and a leftover
  function; the icon and logo are stored smaller (same pixels)
- **Docs:** versions before 2.40.0 moved to CHANGELOG-older.md, so the
  changelog Home Assistant shows when updating opens quicker
- **Change:** tests and caches are left out of the image build

## 2.66.0 — Ready for changes on your supplier's side

- **Feature:** **New from your supplier** (Diagnostics › Health › Supplier):
  anything your supplier sends that the add-on doesn't know (new settings,
  messages it has no answer for, settings a Wallbox doesn't have), things it
  had to refuse and why, errors your supplier sends back, and a new
  connection password, each shown once with when it was first and last seen,
  kept across restarts. A notification for each, if you turn it on (Settings
  › Notifications › When your supplier sends something new)
- **Feature:** your supplier can change the connection password
  (`AuthorizationKey`): it's kept (never logged or shown: hidden in the log
  and message log too) and used from the next connection; if your supplier
  then refuses it, the add-on's own password is tried again. Reports
  `SecurityProfile` 2 (TLS with a password)
- **Feature:** charging profiles work as on a charger: a session's own
  (`TxProfile`) overrides the default for every session (`TxDefaultProfile`),
  the overall cap (`ChargePointMaxProfile`) always applies, and the lowest
  caps the current; Absolute, Relative and Recurring schedules, `validFrom` /
  `validTo` and durations; the default and the cap stay after a session and
  across restarts (before, every profile was cleared when a session ended,
  and the highest stack level won whatever its purpose)
- **Feature:** `GetCompositeSchedule`: what the charger will allow from now,
  all profiles combined (before, it wasn't answered)
- **Improvement:** `SetChargingProfile` is checked as a charger does (and
  refused with the reason in New from your supplier); `ClearChargingProfile`
  answers `Unknown` when nothing matched; Diagnostics shows what each profile
  is for, whether it applies now, and its validity

## 2.65.1 — Reset zoom over the chart

- **Fix:** **Reset zoom** now sits over the History chart's top right corner
  instead of in its heading, where (on a phone) showing it pushed the chart
  down
- **Improvement:** touch gestures follow the finger even when the chart
  redraws under it

## 2.65.0 — Charts on a phone

- **Feature:** the Overview's history chart (power, current, SoC) works by touch: move a finger across it
  to go back or forward in time, pinch to zoom in and out, double tap to go
  back to the whole period, and tap for the reading at that time. A finger
  moving up or down still scrolls the page

## 2.64.2 — Auto plug-in wording

- **Docs:** Automations › Auto plug-in now reads "Plugs in when the monitored
  device's charge drops below a level" (it needn't be a car)

## 2.64.1 — Looks more like a real charger

- **Change:** the connection to your supplier no longer sends a User-Agent
  header (it was the library's own, "Python/3.x websockets/x"); a charger
  usually sends none
- **Improvement:** simulated power is to the watt (0.001 kW) rather than whole
  tens of watts, as a real meter reads (e.g. 1447 W, not 1450 W)

## 2.64.0 — ID tags and settings, as a real charger

- **Feature:** an authorisation cache, as chargers have
  (`AuthorizationCacheEnabled`, on): your supplier's answer for each ID tag is
  remembered, `ClearCache` now empties it, and it's kept across restarts with
  the local list (both shown in Diagnostics › Health › Supplier)
- **Feature:** `LocalPreAuthorize` now works: on, a tag already accepted in
  the local list or cache starts without waiting for `Authorize`
- **Feature:** Wallbox's `AuthEnabled`: off, a remote start goes ahead without
  checking the tag at all
- **Change:** offline, a start now needs the tag to be accepted in the local
  list or cache (or `AllowOfflineTxForUnknownId` on, new, off by default), as
  well as `LocalAuthorizeOffline` on and `AuthEnabledOffline` not off. With
  Octopus nothing changes: it sets `AuthEnabledOffline` off, so an offline
  start doesn't happen, and online starts work as before
- **Feature:** more of the settings a charger reports: `MinimumStatusDuration`,
  the `…MaxLength` limits for the measurand lists, and `AuthEnabledOffline`
  (true until your supplier sets it)
- **Improvement:** setting values are checked as a charger does (true/false,
  whole numbers, measurand lists within their limit) and refused otherwise
- **Fix:** `SendLocalList` follows the rules: a differential update must be a
  newer version, an entry without `idTagInfo` removes that tag, and a list
  over 20 tags is refused

## 2.63.10 — AuthEnabledOffline honoured

- **Change:** Wallbox's `AuthEnabledOffline` setting now does what it does on
  a real Wallbox: set to False (as Octopus does after every connect), a
  remote start whose ID tag can't be checked because the connection is down
  (or drops while checking) isn't started, and shows as a red chip on the
  Overview. Online starts aren't affected

## 2.63.9 — Off-peak in What happens next

- **Feature:** **What happens next** shows your off-peak times (Automations ›
  Schedule): hatched grey on the strip, a box when one starts (with when it
  ends), and in Now's box while you're in one
- **Fix:** a box's text could wrap a word early (its width was rounded down)

## 2.63.8 — What happens next, earlier further out

- **Fix:** in **What happens next**, when things are close together the
  earlier ones go further out (higher above the strip, lower below it) and
  the later ones nearer it, so a line no longer runs through another box
- **Fix:** a box placed below the strip could stay hidden after the card
  redrew (e.g. 20:00 missing until the page was reloaded)

## 2.63.7 — What happens next, above and below

- **Change:** **What happens next** is back to the clearer boxes (big time,
  what happens, details), each at its time on the strip: above it, or below
  it where it would overlap the one before (then a row further out), so
  lines never run through a box. Replaces the one-line labels from 2.63.5

## 2.63.6 — What happens next, soonest at the top

- **Fix:** in **What happens next**, the soonest label now sits on the top row
  and later ones step down towards the strip, so a later event's line no
  longer runs through an earlier label

## 2.63.5 — What happens next, compact

- **Improvement:** **What happens next** is about half the height: what's
  happening now (and what's next, and how long until) is one line, and each
  thing to come is a one-line label at its time just above the strip (e.g.
  "14:30 Plug in → 19:00", "19:00 Unplug · Saving session → 20:00"; hover for
  more), in its colour, going up a row only where labels would overlap

## 2.63.4 — What happens next, on the timeline

- **Improvement:** **What happens next** puts each thing at its time on the
  strip below it: its line meets the strip at that time (14:30 at 14:30),
  with things close together on another row instead of overlapping. On a
  phone it's at least an hour to 60 px and scrolls sideways, rather than
  the boxes stacking on top of each other

## 2.63.3 — The ready time follows the schedule

- **Fix:** changing the schedule while plugged in for a slot (editing or
  dragging its end, a saving session moving it, removing the hours over...)
  didn't change your supplier's ready time: it stayed at the old unplug until
  the next plug-in. It's now set again as soon as the unplug it's plugged in
  for moves

## 2.63.2 — Ready time after a restart

- **Fix:** restarted while plugged in for a slot (e.g. an update), the ready
  time wasn't set again, so one that had failed before the restart (and its
  retries, which aren't kept) stayed unset. It's now set again at start-up
  whenever it's plugged in for a slot with Force schedule on

## 2.63.1 — Ready time, again

- **Fix:** when setting your supplier's ready time failed at a plug-in (e.g.
  Octopus's integration: "Device status could not be fetched"), it wasn't
  tried again, so the app kept the old time. It's now tried again after 1,
  2, 5, 10... minutes (8 times, about 1½ hours) while it's still plugged in
  for the same unplug; the Automations tab says when

## 2.63.0 — Which saving session

- **Improvement:** saving sessions that overlap (e.g. Octopus's 18:00–19:00
  and Axle Energy's 18:30–20:00) are still one for the schedule, but the
  timelines (Sessions, Automations, What happens next) show each as it runs,
  in two lanes where they overlap, with the one going now stronger ("Now:"
  on hover). The Saving sessions list shows each under the time they cover
  together, with **Now** by the one running

## 2.62.0 — Like a wallbox

- **Feature:** the add-on reports the rest of the settings a charger must
  have (`LocalAuthorizeOffline`, `LocalPreAuthorize`, `ConnectionTimeOut`,
  `ResetRetries`, `TransactionMessageAttempts`,
  `TransactionMessageRetryInterval`), at the values a wallbox typically has.
  Before, your supplier got "unknown key" for them
- **Change:** a start, stop or meter reading your supplier fails to process
  is sent again, as a wallbox does: up to `TransactionMessageAttempts` (3)
  tries, waiting `TransactionMessageRetryInterval` (60 s) times the tries so
  far, in order. Before, it was dropped straight away. With
  `LocalAuthorizeOffline` turned off by your supplier, a start that can't be
  checked (offline) doesn't go ahead

## 2.61.1 — Last week's saving sessions

- **Fix:** the Sessions tab's last 7 days could miss a saving session the
  add-on hadn't kept (e.g. one found before an update, when they were kept
  for a day). The ones that are over are now read from the calendar too, a
  week back, and shown alongside the ones the add-on kept

## 2.61.0 — The ID tag, checked

- **Feature:** with `AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests` on (the default, as the
  add-on has always reported), a start your supplier asks for checks the ID
  tag with it first (`Authorize`), as a real charger does, and only starts if
  it's accepted. Offline, or if the check fails, it starts anyway. Your
  supplier can turn the setting off
- **Feature:** your supplier's answer to `StartTransaction` is followed: if it
  says the ID tag isn't valid (Invalid, Blocked, Expired, ConcurrentTx), with
  `StopTransactionOnInvalidId` off (the default) the session stays open but
  no energy is delivered (SuspendedEVSE) until your supplier stops it; with
  it on, the session is stopped (DeAuthorized). Before, the answer was
  ignored and it carried on charging. A red chip on the Overview says so

## 2.60.0 — Amps and volts

- **Feature:** meter values include the current the car draws
  (`Current.Import`, 0 A when it isn't charging) and the supply voltage
  (`Voltage`: your voltage sensor or set value, as on Settings › Voltage)
  when your supplier asks for them, as a real charger does. Before, they were
  left out

## 2.59.0 — Remove the hours over

- **Feature:** a slot with hours over your supplier's daily limit (in red)
  has a button in its editor that takes them off: **Remove the 30m over**
  makes it end (or start) that much sooner, at a ready time your supplier
  accepts (a weekly slot: every week). A slot that's all over has **Remove
  it** instead, which deletes it (a weekly one asks: every week, or just
  this one)

## 2.58.5 — Not past off-peak

- **Fix:** a slot that ends later for a saving session (it had started, or
  starting earlier would be in the past) carried on around your off-peak
  hours, e.g. 20:00–23:30 and then 05:30–06:00 the next morning. It now stops
  at the start of an off-peak time, since the car can charge then anyway;
  the note says so. Sessions already found aren't moved again: turn **No
  charging during a session** off and on to redo them

## 2.58.4 — Cut short, drawn short

- **Fix:** a slot that was going when a saving session cut it short (e.g.
  15:30–21:30 with an 18:00–20:00 session found at 16:20: 15:30–18:00, then
  20:00–23:30) was drawn on the Automations tab as one slot to 23:30, with
  the 18:00 unplug as a tick. It runs as it should; it's now drawn that way
  too, 15:30–18:00 and 20:00–23:30

## 2.58.3 — Over which days

- **Fix:** on the Automations tab, a slot over your supplier's daily limit
  was labelled only up to where the limit ran out (a 15:30–22:00 slot read
  15:30–21:30, with the last half hour in red), so it looked as if the red
  had nothing to do with the slot. Slots now show their whole time, and the
  warning lists every day that's over, not just the worst
- **Improvement:** the Saving sessions card says when Axle Energy's sensors
  aren't found (and what it looked for), as well as when they are

## 2.58.2 — What saving sessions do

- **Improvement:** the Saving sessions card says what it reads the sessions
  from, that the two switches decide what's done about them, and, under it,
  what it does now: e.g. "1h of charging is added before each session, but
  charging during a session isn't changed (turn on No charging during a
  session to move it out)"

## 2.58.1 — Delete anyway

- **Fix:** deleting a slot that the add-on warned takes a day over your
  supplier's daily limit: **Save anyway** saved the slot again instead of
  deleting it, so nothing happened. The button is now **Delete anyway**, and
  deletes it

## 2.58.0 — A week of sessions

- **Change:** the Sessions tab keeps the last 7 days of sessions and
  plug-ins that never got a session (today and the 6 days before, as its
  timeline shows), rather than the last 20 of each. Older ones are dropped

## 2.57.1 — Together

- **Improvement:** **What happens next** lists things at the same time in
  one box (e.g. an unplug at 18:00 and a saving session from 18:00), and a
  saving session that's going already in Now's

## 2.57.0 — What happens next, and notifications

- **Feature:** **What happens next** on the Overview: now, then the next few
  things in the coming 16 hours (the schedule plugging in and unplugging
  with the ready time, your supplier's planned slots, saving sessions), and
  a strip of those hours
- **Feature:** notifications when the schedule changes (Settings ›
  Notifications): pick a Home Assistant notify service (e.g. your phone's)
  and turn it on. Whatever changes it, each day that changed, before and
  after, and why where the schedule says, once it's settled for a minute.
  **Send a test** to check
- **Feature:** drag either end of a slot on the Automations tab to change
  its times (in half hours), saved straight away
- **Feature:** slots that meet are drawn joined, with a link where they meet
  (hover: the ready time for the whole charge), and a gap where they're split
  at your supplier's daily limit reset
- **Feature:** an open page says when the add-on has been updated, with a
  **Reload** button
- **Improvement:** every session on the Sessions tab says what started it
  (**Schedule**, **Charge now**, **By hand**...), not only one-offs
- **Improvement:** a **Check** chip on the Overview when something's wrong
  with your supplier's integration (hover for what, click for
  Diagnostics › Health)

## 2.56.0 — Slots that meet are one charge

- **Change:** where one slot ends as the next starts (your slots, a slot
  moved for a saving session, Charge now, auto plug-in or the car plugged in
  sensor running into a slot), it now carries on plugged in, as one charge:
  no unplug and plug back in, and the ready time is set to the last one's
  end when it plugs in. They're still shown and changed separately. Where
  your supplier's daily limit resets (Octopus: 12:00) it still unplugs and
  plugs back in, so the supplier sees a charge either side

## 2.55.2 — As soon as it can

- **Change:** when a saving session is found too late for a slot to start
  earlier by the time it takes out (its start would be in the past), the
  slot now starts at the next half hour and ends later only by what's left,
  rather than keeping its start and ending later by the whole session. A
  15:30–21:30 slot with an 18:00–20:00 session found at 13:45: 14:00–18:00
  and 20:00–22:00 (was 15:30–18:00 and 20:00–23:30). Found within half an
  hour of the slot's start, it keeps its start as before. Sessions already
  found aren't moved again

## 2.55.1 — Saving session adjusted

- **Change:** on the Sessions tab, a charge from one of your slots that was
  moved for a saving session is tagged **Saving session adjusted** (was
  **One-off**), for as long as the saving session is kept (a week)

## 2.55.0 — Axle Energy events, and today's plan

- **Feature:** saving sessions from Axle Energy: its export events
  (`sensor.axle_energy_event_start`, `_end` and `_type`, found automatically)
  are saving sessions, as from a calendar, with or without one. Its import
  events (use more) are left out. The sensors are listed on the Saving
  sessions card, and the sources are in `suppliers.json`
  (`saving_sessions.sensors`), so another one like it can be added there
- **Feature:** the Sessions tab's Today row shows today's plan: your
  supplier's planned charge slots (dashed, in its colour, with their kWh)
  and when the schedule plugs in (a dashed band)

## 2.54.3 — The last week, by the clock

- **Fix:** after the clocks went back, the Sessions tab's last 7 days drew the
  days before the change an hour early (a 15:31 charge showed from about
  14:30; its times on hover were right). Each day is now drawn by the clock,
  so 15:30 is under 15:00 on either side of a change. The Automations tab's
  past days, charges and your supplier's planned slots had the same problem
  across a change, and are fixed too
- **Feature:** the Sessions tab's last 7 days show the saving sessions
  (hatched; hover for the time and name). Saving sessions are now kept for
  a week after they end (was a day), so the week has them all

## 2.54.2 — Not during a session

- **Change:** **Move to another install**'s Export and Import wait while a
  charging session is going (the page says so and greys them out), so the
  session's meter readings and the energy register aren't split between the
  two installs. Unplug, or wait for it to finish

## 2.54.1 — The serial number, moved

- **Fix:** moving to another install where the old one had its serial number
  only on the Configuration tab left the new install's own made-up serial in
  its serial file (the Configuration tab's, moved, was still the one used):
  the file now gets the moved serial too

## 2.54.0 — Move to another install

- **Feature:** **Diagnostics › Move to another install**: **Export** downloads
  one file with this install's settings (the Configuration tab, with or
  without the password; the schedule and the Automations tab; your sensors,
  supplier settings and supplier changes; the page's settings, max current
  and simulated car; the charger's serial and lifetime energy register) and,
  if you like, its history (sessions and OCPP messages). **Import** on the
  other install shows what's in the file, warns if the old add-on is still
  running, then sets the Configuration tab, puts the rest in place and
  restarts. For moving from the ocpp_charge_proxy repository's add-on to the
  HA_Addons one without entering anything again. The energy register never
  goes backwards

## 2.53.2 — Slots can be changed again

- **Fix:** changing, turning off or deleting a slot could fail with "At most
  50 schedule entries": the limit counted one-off times that had already run
  (kept for 14 days, for the Sessions tab) and the charges the add-on adds
  (auto plug-in, Charge now, the car plugged in sensor...), so after a
  couple of weeks of auto plug-ins no slot could be changed. Now only your
  own count (weekly times and one-offs still to come: up to 100, i.e. 50
  slots); Cancel this charge was affected too

## 2.53.1 — Tidier code

- **Change:** a tidy of the code, with no change to what the add-on does:
  every JSON file in `/data` is now read and written by one helper
  (`src/jsonfile.py`), so they're all written the safe way (atomically,
  keeping a good `.bak` copy that a broken file never replaces) and fall
  back to the copy the same way. The web API's errors come from one helper,
  the page's times from one formatter, and unused code is gone

## 2.53.0 — Following your supplier's changes

- **Feature:** your own changes to the supplier defaults, in `suppliers.json`
  in the add-on's folder in Home Assistant (`/addon_configs/...`): only
  what's different, read again within a minute or so of changing, so a
  supplier's change can be followed the same day without an update.
  `suppliers.example.json` there has the add-on's own, to copy from
- **Feature:** the add-on notices when your supplier's integration looks
  changed and says so on the Overview's Smart charging card, Diagnostics ›
  Health and in the log: its sensor without the slots, slots in another
  format, its integration there but no smart charging sensor, no ready time
  entity, or the sensor unavailable. Health shows each supplier
  integration's version, and for a week after one's updated, from what to
  what
- **Change:** everything the add-on knows about a supplier is now in the
  supplier defaults, not the code: as well as its limit and ready times, the
  names of its sensor, the attributes and fields of its slots, its ready
  time entity, its saving sessions calendar's words, its colour and its
  integration. Each kind of supplier integration (Kraken: Octopus Energy and
  EDF Energy; a schedule sensor: E.ON Next) is one file in
  `src/supplier_types/`
- **Change:** the add-on now maps its own folder in Home Assistant (for
  `suppliers.json`)
- **Docs:** *When your supplier changes something*: how it's noticed, and
  how to follow it with `suppliers.json`, with every field

## 2.52.0 — Fixes from a review, and clearer pages

- **Fix:** turning the random start delay off while a plug-in was waiting
  out the delay cancelled it: it now plugs in straight away
- **Fix:** with the random start delay on, a slot that started while the car
  was already plugged in didn't set your supplier's ready time; there's no
  delay then now, just the ready time
- **Fix:** the night the clocks go forward, a slot with a time that doesn't
  exist (e.g. 01:30–02:30 in the UK) stayed plugged in for about 24 hours and
  every change that week was refused as over the daily limit. A missing time
  now runs at 02:00, and a slot that's all in the missing hour doesn't run
- **Fix:** restarted where two slots meet (e.g. 06:00–12:00 and 12:00–18:00),
  it unplugged and stayed unplugged until 18:00; it now stays plugged in,
  with the ready time for the new slot. A plug-in waiting out its random
  delay still waits after a restart
- **Fix:** a Charge now, auto plug-in or car plugged in charge that started
  while the add-on was stopped wasn't plugged in at start-up with the
  schedule off
- **Fix:** a scheduled plug-in due while auto re-plug had the car unplugged
  (its Unplugged for time can be up to 5 minutes) could be dropped as late,
  with no ready time set
- **Fix:** the extra unplug and plug-in a saving session adds at the daily
  limit's reset time were recorded against the wrong session, so cancelling
  the right one left them behind
- **Fix:** settings only take real true/false values (the text "false"
  turned the schedule on), bad requests get a clear error instead of a
  server error, one-off slots can be at most 62 days ahead (one years away
  slowed everything down), and a refused change no longer leaves part of it
  applied
- **Feature:** **Stop for today** on a slot that's going now: it unplugs and
  runs again next time. Deleting a weekly slot asks: every week, or just
  this one? The slot editor shows the date, labels its on/off switch
  (**Active**) and warns about **No unplug**
- **Feature:** **Cancel this charge** after Charge now: it comes out of the
  schedule, what it changed is put back, and it unplugs unless a slot has
  the car plugged in
- **Feature:** a **Plug in** / **Unplug** button on the Overview
- **Improvement:** while a plug-in waits out its random start delay, the
  Overview and the Automations banner say when it'll plug in, and the slot
  is hatched until then
- **Improvement:** Charge now says your supplier's daily limit in plain words
  (Octopus: "at most 6 hours of smart charging from 12:00 one day to 12:00
  the next"), from your supplier's settings: none is shown for a supplier
  without one. The lengths over it are marked
- **Improvement:** **+ Add a slot** starts at the next free 2 hours
- **Improvement:** the add-on's Plugged In is called **Plugged In (virtual)**
  on the page, so it isn't confused with your car's real cable; the
  simulated car's start delay is now **Pause before drawing power**, and its
  card is greyed out while your power sensor is used
- **Improvement:** on a phone, the schedule and session timelines show fewer
  hour labels and only the slot and charge labels that fit; the random start
  delay's switch sits with its title
- **Improvement:** older OCPP messages on the Overview show their date;
  sessions outside your supplier's slots say so; Charge now and car plugged
  in colours are easier to see in dark mode
- **Docs:** switch your charger from the Status sensor (the Power sensor
  reads 0 until the charger's on, if you use your own power sensor); a
  section on your supplier's daily limit, with an example; the slot colours,
  the random start delay and the Automations cards brought up to date

## 2.51.1 — Set the start delay before turning it on

- **Improvement:** the random start delay's minutes can be changed with its
  switch off, so it's ready before you turn it on

## 2.51.0 — Random start delay

- **Feature:** a **Random start delay** for your schedule (Automations tab,
  under the schedule; off by default): each of your slots plugs in a random
  time after it starts, up to the minutes you set (1 to 60) and at most half
  the slot, so it isn't the same time every day. Only your own slots: auto
  plug-in, the car plugged in sensor, Charge now and the charge before a
  saving session still plug in straight away, as does a slot that starts
  where another ends. The Overview shows "Plugging in at …" while it waits

## 2.50.5 — Car slots stay separate with the schedule off

- With the schedule off, a car slot (low-SoC auto plug-in, the car plugged in
  sensor, Charge now, or the charge before a saving session) stays separate
  from your slots: it doesn't join them (2.50.4 joined them). It still trims
  or skips your later slots to keep within your supplier's daily limit,
  counted as if the schedule were on and joined, so it all fits when the
  schedule's turned back on; it joins your slots then
- The charge before a saving session now does the same: with the schedule
  off it counts your slots for the daily limit and trims your next one

## 2.50.4 — Car slots with the schedule off

- With the schedule off, the switch only pauses your own slots: they're greyed
  out in the week, while car slots (auto plug-in, Charge now, the car plugged
  in sensor) stay in colour, as they still run. The banner shows the next car
  slot time (and so does the Overview's chip) instead of just "Paused"
- A car slot planned with the schedule off now fits around your slots as it
  would with it on: it joins the ones it meets, and trims or skips later ones
  for your supplier's daily limit. With the schedule off it still ends at its
  own end; turned back on, it's already one with your slots
- The daily limit counts the schedule as it runs with it on, also while it's off

## 2.50.3 — Turning the schedule on checks the daily limit

- Turning the schedule on now checks your supplier's daily limit (Octopus: 6
  hours, with Force schedule on supplier on). A charge planned while it was off
  only counted the other charges, so joined with the schedule's slots a day
  could go over. If it would, it asks first, with **Turn on anyway** (the hours
  over then show in red). Not if the slots alone were already over
- A charge that ends just as a scheduled slot starts (or starts as one ends)
  now joins it too when the schedule's turned on

## 2.50.2 — Turning the schedule on and off

- **Turned on during a slot:** it plugs in until the slot's end (as at
  start-up), with the ready time set to it if Force schedule on supplier is on
- **Turned on during a car slot** (a charge from auto plug-in, the car plugged
  in sensor or Charge now, planned while the schedule was off): the charge
  joins the slots it meets, as if planned with the schedule on, so it's
  plugged in until whichever ends last. Before, the charge's own end cut the
  slot short (or the slot's end cut the charge short)
- **Turned off during a slot:** it unplugs. During a car slot it doesn't: the
  charge separates from the slot it joined and carries on to its own end (the
  ready time set back to it). Not plugged in by the schedule (e.g. by hand,
  outside a slot): left alone

## 2.50.1 — Unplugged after the charge, with the schedule off

- Auto plug-in, Charge now and the car plugged in sensor still unplug at the
  end of their charge after the schedule's turned off. A charge that met a
  scheduled slot became one with it and ended with the slot's unplug, which
  doesn't run with the schedule off, so the car stayed plugged in. It now
  keeps its own unplug as well, used only while the schedule is off (not
  shown in the week, or counted, while it's on)

## 2.50.0 — Over the daily limit, if you choose

- Everywhere the schedule is refused for going over your supplier's daily
  limit (Octopus: 6 hours), you can now go ahead anyway: **Save anyway**
  (saving a slot), **Put it back anyway** (undoing a skip), **Turn on
  anyway** (Force schedule on supplier) and **Turn back on anyway**
  (Diagnostics › Scheduling guards). Charge now already had **Charge anyway**
- The schedule shows just the hours past the limit as a red block of their
  own on the slot (it used to colour the whole slot red). E.g. 4 hours last
  night and a 3-hour slot this morning, the same day from 12:00: its last
  hour is red, as your supplier may not charge then. Also with the guards
  overridden
- The unplug times your supplier accepts are still checked

## 2.49.5 — Clearing the session history clears it all

- Diagnostics › Clear data › Session history now also clears the plugged-in
  times on the Sessions tab's 7-day chart, and the backup copy of the
  history (it used to keep the old one). The energy totals on the Sessions
  tab start again from the clear. The page redraws straight away
- A session in progress, and a plug-in now, carry on. The Overview chart's
  power readings are Home Assistant's own history, so they stay

## 2.49.4 — Time drop-downs stay open

- Schedule: a slot's time drop-down no longer closes by itself while you
  scroll through it. The page's refresh every few seconds redrew the week,
  editor included; it now waits until you've finished with the editor

## 2.49.3 — Re-plug after means what it says

- Auto re-plug: the wait is now the minutes set, from plugging in. It used
  to start at the next hour or half hour while your supplier's slot was
  running, so 5 minutes at 22:14 re-plugged at 22:35
- Your supplier's slots, planned or running now, are left to it: no
  re-plug. With no slots, or no supplier found, it re-plugs after the wait

## 2.49.2 — Each tab from the top

- **Change:** switching tab goes back to the top of the page, instead of
  staying as far down as you'd scrolled on the last one.

## 2.49.1 — Sessions in your supplier's colour

- **Change:** on the Sessions tab, a session charged in your supplier's
  dispatch slots is drawn in its colour (Octopus purple, E.ON red, EDF
  amber), on the 7-day timeline and in the list's energy bar. Others stay
  green; the key says which is which.

## 2.49.0 — The page tidied up

- **Improvement:** the Overview's banner holds the charger's state, the
  connection and transaction, and Power, Current, Car SoC and the energy
  meter as tiles; the last messages received and sent are one **OCPP
  messages** card, with a link to the full log.
- **Improvement:** cards side by side no longer leave gaps under the
  shorter one (the Automations tab's Auto plug-in, Car plugged in, Saving
  sessions and Auto re-plug; the Settings sections; the Debug tools). The
  daily limit is said once, in the Charge now banner; the schedule's key is
  smaller; Max current fits on one line.
- **Improvement:** Settings' **Show all sensors in the lists** is at the
  top of the sensors it affects.
- **Improvement:** Diagnostics › Debug puts the log first and the tools
  beside each other below it; replies sit quietly under their message, and
  Drop, Restart and Clear are in red. On Health, held messages sit with the
  other cards and the configuration keys fold away (**Show the keys**).
- **Fix:** Diagnostics › Health's Charging profiles card was empty (and the
  configuration table not drawn) when a profile was in amps.

## 2.48.0 — Off-peak times

- **Change:** no-charging times are now called **off-peak times**, as
  that's what they're for: your off-peak hours, when the car may well
  charge anyway.
- **Change (undoes part of 2.43.8):** auto plug-in, the car plugged in
  sensor and Charge now only carry on later after a **saving session**.
  Round an off-peak time they unplug at its start and plug back in at its
  end, but still end when they would have (12 hours from 21:30 with
  23:30–05:30 off peak: 21:30–23:30, then 05:30–09:30). One that starts
  during an off-peak time plugs in at its end only if the charge would
  still be running.

## 2.47.0 — Charge now in the schedule, and a colourful theme

- **Improvement:** on the Automations tab, **Charge now** and the
  **Schedule** are one card. Its banner shows what the schedule does next
  (e.g. **Unplug at 21:30**, with how long until and what it did last; grey
  and **Paused** when the schedule is off), the schedule's On switch, and
  the Charge now buttons.
- **New:** a coloured banner at the top of each tab, from blue to your
  supplier's colour (Octopus purple, E.ON red, EDF amber): the charger state
  on Overview, the totals on Sessions, and on Diagnostics the overall health
  (green when all is well, orange or red when something needs attention).
- **New:** Settings › **Appearance**: choose **Colourful** (the banners) or
  **Basic** (plain cards). Saved in each browser.

## 2.46.0 — Recent sessions with a 7-day timeline

- **Improvement:** the Sessions tab's **Recent sessions** card opens with a
  timeline of the last 7 days: when the car was plugged in (coloured by what
  plugged it in: the schedule, auto plug-in, Charge now, ...), when it
  actually charged (with the kWh), and each day's energy and time charging.
  Click a day to show only its sessions in the list below (again to show
  all), or click a charge to open that session's details.
- **Change:** the **Per day** chart is gone (the timeline replaces it).

## 2.45.1 — The schedule without the past days

- **Change:** the Automations tab's schedule shows today and the next 6
  days only. The last 3 days (when the car was actually plugged in, which
  could look out of line with the schedule, e.g. an unplug that waited for
  your supplier) are gone from it; past sessions are on the Sessions tab.

## 2.45.0 — The schedule redesigned

- **Improvement:** the Automations tab's schedule is easier to read (the
  way it works is unchanged): "As it happened" and "Coming up" sections,
  each day with its name (Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow...) and date, taller
  rows with gridlines and times every 3 hours, slots as rounded blocks
  labelled with their times, what was charged as a green line under them,
  your supplier's planned slots outlined, the past of today dimmed and a
  marker for now. The next action is shown as a pill above, the slot editor
  opens as a card under its day, and the legend is clearer.

## 2.44.0 — Recent sessions redesigned

- **Improvement:** the Sessions tab's Recent sessions are now a row each
  instead of a table: the day and times, how it started (Charge now, Auto
  plug-in, your supplier's slot...), the energy with a bar against the
  biggest session shown, its length and peak, and how it ended as a
  coloured label (charging now, stopped by your supplier, unplugged, an
  add-on restart...). Plug-ins that never got a session are greyed. Click a
  row for its details and power curve, as before.

## 2.43.8 — Charges keep their hours around no-charging times

- **Change:** auto plug-in, the car plugged in sensor and Charge now carry
  on after a no-charging time or saving session for the time it took out,
  instead of ending when they would have (3 hours from 17:55 with an
  18:00–19:00 session: 17:55–18:00, then 19:00–22:00, not 21:00). One that
  starts during one plugs in at its end for its full hours. The end is a
  ready time your supplier accepts, and the daily limit still applies.

## 2.43.7 — Unplug at the start of a no-charging time

- **Feature:** at the start of each no-charging time it unplugs if the car
  is plugged in, e.g. by hand or from Home Assistant, as nothing should
  charge then.
- **Change:** saving sessions no longer add an unplug at their start
  (2.43.6); that was meant for no-charging times. One already added is
  taken out.

## 2.43.6 — Saving sessions: unplug at the start

- **Feature:** with No charging during a session on, each session gets an
  unplug at its start (a one-off on the schedule), so the car stops even if
  it was plugged in by hand or from Home Assistant. Not added if the
  schedule already unplugs then (e.g. a charge before the session ends
  there); taken out with the rest if the session is cancelled or the switch
  is turned off.

## 2.43.5 — Schedule view: slots whose unplug is skipped

- **Fix:** the schedule view drew a slot to its own unplug even when that
  was skipped, so a charge before a saving session that joined it looked
  like nothing was added (16:30–17:30 plus a stray unplug at 18:00 instead
  of 16:30–18:00), or like it stopped at the joined slot's end (16:00–17:30
  instead of 16:00–18:00). A slot now runs to the next unplug that does
  run, and that unplug isn't shown on its own. The schedule itself was
  right.

## 2.43.4 — Saving sessions on the schedule

- **Fix:** the schedule view showed a slot moved for a saving session
  under the weekly slot it replaces that day, as one slot (and paired the
  moved part with the weekly unplug it skips). The weekly slot isn't drawn
  that day now, and the moved times show in purple as "Moved for a saving
  session".
- **Change:** Plug in before a session adds its charge to the schedule as
  soon as the session is known (shown in purple), not only when its time
  comes, for the time the schedule doesn't already cover; over the daily
  limit, the next slot after the session starts later. Turning it off or
  changing the hours takes it out or redoes it.

## 2.43.3 — Saving sessions: no start in the past

- **Fix:** if starting a slot earlier for a saving session would put its
  start in the past, it keeps its start and ends later instead (15:30–21:30
  with an 18:00–19:00 session found at 14:40: 15:30–18:00 and 19:00–22:30),
  not in a no-charging time and joining the next slot if it meets it. A
  slot already running carries on after the session the same way, instead
  of being cut short.

## 2.43.2 — Saving sessions: charge before only when needed

- **Fix:** Plug in before a session adds nothing if the schedule already
  has the car plugged in for those hours (e.g. a slot moved to end as the
  session starts), and only the missing time if it covers part of them. As
  before, the next slot starts later if it'd take a day over the daily limit.

## 2.43.1 — Saving sessions: slots start earlier

- **Fix:** a slot that runs into a saving session now keeps its end time
  and its hours and starts earlier by the time the session takes out of it
  (15:30–21:30 with an 18:00–19:00 session: 14:30–18:00 and 19:00–21:30).
  It was carried on later instead (19:00–22:30), past its ready time.
  Slots moved by 2.43.0 are moved again.
- **Improvement:** a slot moved earlier that meets the slot before joins it.

## 2.43.0 — Saving sessions

- **Feature:** a Saving sessions card on the Automations tab (off by
  default). It reads your saving sessions from a Home Assistant calendar,
  found automatically for Octopus Energy (Power Down / Saving Sessions) and
  by its name for E.ON Next and EDF, or picked.
- **Feature:** No charging during a session (its own switch): each session
  is a no-charging time, and a scheduled slot that runs into it carries on
  the session's length later. Put back if the session is cancelled.
- **Feature:** Plug in before a session (its own switch): a charge of the
  chosen hours, ending as the session starts, added as Charge now adds one,
  within the daily limit.
- **Improvement:** sessions are shown hatched on the schedule, and the
  card lists the ones coming up with what was changed for each.

## 2.42.0 — Charge now buttons in Home Assistant

- **Feature:** the Charge now buttons are Home Assistant entities:
  `input_button.ocpp_charge_proxy_charge_now_1h`, `_2h`, `_3h`, `_4h`,
  `_6h`, `_8h` and `_12h`, created by the add-on. Press one, or call
  `input_button.press` from an automation, to charge now for that long,
  as the web page's button does. From Home Assistant it goes ahead even
  over the supplier's daily limit, as auto plug-in does.
- **Improvement:** Diagnostics › Health lists the Charge now buttons with the
  add-on's other entities.

## 2.41.2 — Unused code removed

- **Change:** removed code nothing used any more: the old idle and
  charging meter-value builders (meter values come from one builder), an
  unused ID-masking helper, the charging profiles' text summary, and two
  one-line automation helpers only the tests called. No change to how the
  add-on behaves.

## 2.41.1 — A how-to README

- **Docs:** a new README (the add-on's Info page in Home Assistant): what
  it does and how it works, what you need, installing, the add-on options,
  setting it up tab by tab, an automation to switch your charger, its
  entities and troubleshooting.

## 2.41.0 — A switch for Car plugged in

- **Feature:** the Car plugged in card (Automations tab) has an on/off
  switch, as Auto plug-in has: off, the sensor stays set but its turning
  on doesn't plug in or add a charge. It's on unless you switch it off, so
  nothing changes until you do.

## 2.40.1 — A charge that runs past a scheduled slot keeps its end

- **Fix:** an auto plug-in (car plugged in, low SoC) or Charge now that
  overlapped a scheduled slot but went on past it was cut short at the
  slot's unplug. E.g. plugged in at 18:30 for a charge to 23:00, with a
  19:00–21:00 slot: it became one slot to 21:00, and the ready time was set
  for 21:00, not 23:00. Now the joined slot runs to whichever ends last
  (here 23:00), and the scheduled slot's own plug-in and unplug inside it
  are skipped that once. A charge that reaches one slot that meets the next
  joins both.
