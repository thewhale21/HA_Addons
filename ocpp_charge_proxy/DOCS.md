# Home Assistant Add-on: OCPP Charge Proxy

## How to use

This add-on acts as a virtual OCPP 1.6 chargepoint and connects to any
OCPP 1.6J server. When the server sends charge scheduling commands, the add-on
updates its state so Home Assistant automations can respond.

## Prerequisites

- An OCPP 1.6J compatible supplier account (or any CSMS that accepts OCPP 1.6
  chargepoint connections)
- OCPP connection credentials (server hostname, chargepoint ID, password)
  from your supplier

## Configuration

### Required options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `server_hostname` | Your supplier's OCPP server hostname |
| `chargepoint_id` | Your chargepoint ID for authentication |
| `password` | Your OCPP password |

### Optional options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `charger_model` | `PLP2-0-2-2` | Charger model reported in BootNotification |
| `charger_vendor` | `Wall Box Chargers` | Charger vendor reported in BootNotification |
| `charger_serial` | Auto-generated | Charger serial number (generated on first boot if empty) |
| `firmware_version` | `6.11.16` | Firmware version reported in BootNotification |
| `initial_energy_wh` | `0` | Seed the energy register (Wh). Set to your old charger's meter reading when migrating. Only applied if higher than the stored register (the meter never goes backwards); cleared after first boot. |

The max current and **Continue session after a restart** are set on the web
page's Settings tab (Controls), and the log level on Diagnostics › Debug.
They used to be add-on options; they're kept across restarts and updates.
OCPP messages are logged at `info`, except Heartbeats and periodic meter
readings (in a session or not), which only show at `debug`. Clock-aligned
readings stay at `info` during a session (outside one, they're `debug` too).

### Controlling your charger

Use the **Status** sensor (`sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_status`) to switch your
charger or smart plug: turn it on when the status becomes `Charging` and off
when it stops being `Charging` (the README has the automation to paste).
Don't use the Power sensor for this if you've picked your own power sensor
(below): that reads 0 until the charger is switched on, so it would never
switch on.

### Power entity

You can optionally pick a Home Assistant power sensor (W or kW) on the
add-on's **Settings** tab. The proxy will report this real power value to your
supplier instead of simulating power delivery. The value is capped at what the
virtual chargepoint could physically deliver at its current setting.

If not configured, the proxy uses a realistic power simulation.

### SoC sensor for reporting

You can also pick a **SoC sensor** on the Settings tab, for example from
your car's own integration, reporting 0–100%. When set:

- The car's state of charge is sent to your supplier whenever it asks for
  `SoC` in its meter values (Octopus does), while a car is plugged in.
- **Car full:** when the sensor reads 100% during a session, the charger
  reports `SuspendedEV` and stops drawing power, as a real car does when its
  battery is full. The session stays open; if the SoC drops below 100%,
  charging resumes. A charging-profile pause (`SuspendedEVSE`) takes priority.

Leave it unset (or clear it) and no SoC is reported and car-full never
triggers. If the sensor becomes unavailable, SoC reporting pauses until it
comes back.

### Your supplier's daily limit

Some suppliers only schedule so many hours of smart charging a day. The add-on
keeps to your supplier's limit while **Force schedule on supplier** is on
(Automations tab), and the page shows it wherever it matters:

- **Octopus Energy:** 6 hours, counted from 12:00 one day to 12:00 the next.
  So 23:30–05:30 (6 hours) is fine, and so is 06:00–12:00 then 12:00–18:00
  (6 hours each side of 12:00); but 23:30–05:30 plus a 3-hour Charge now at
  18:00 the evening before is 9 hours in one 12:00-to-12:00 day, so the
  add-on asks first, and if you go ahead it starts that night's slot 3 hours
  later (02:30–05:30) to stay within 6.
- **Other suppliers** (EDF Energy, E.ON Next...) and **no supplier:** no limit.
- **Settings › Your supplier** can change it (a number of hours, 0 for none,
  or empty for automatic) and when it resets (a time of day, or rolling: any
  24 hours). If Octopus changes its hours, set them there, or in your own
  `suppliers.json` (see [When your supplier changes
  something](#when-your-supplier-changes-something)), until the add-on is
  updated.

The details:

- Hours are real hours, as suppliers count them: the night the clocks go
  back, 23:30–05:30 is 7 hours (5 the night they go forward).
- A slot or charge that would go over is shown with its extra hours in red,
  and the add-on asks before saving it (**Save anyway**, **Charge anyway**...).
- A charge that would go over trims your next slot by whole half hours (or
  skips it, and trims the one after), for that day only.
- With Force schedule on supplier off, or the scheduling guards overridden
  (Diagnostics › Debug), there's no limit.

### Auto plug-in, the car plugged in sensor and Charge now

**Auto plug-in** (Automations tab) switches Plugged In on once when the SoC
drops below the level you set. With **Automatically adjust schedule to fit
auto plug-in** on, it also adds the charge to the schedule as a one-off,
for the hours you choose (**Charge for**, 0.5 to 12). The **Car plugged in**
sensor (Automations tab) can do the same when it plugs in: turn on **Add a
charge to the schedule** and set its own **Charge for**. The switch on its
card turns it off without forgetting the sensor (as the one on Auto
plug-in does): the sensor turning on then does nothing. **Charge now**
works the same way. In each case:

- The slot runs from plugging in to the first ready time your supplier
  accepts at least that long away (rounded up to the half hour; with EDF,
  the next time between 04:00 and 11:00). It unplugs then, after the
  supplier stops the session or the unplug wait (60 s by default).
- **Off-peak times** (below) are left out: it unplugs at the start of one
  and plugs back in at its end, and the charge still ends when it would
  have (the car may well charge in your off-peak hours anyway). If it
  happens during one, it isn't plugged in then, only at its end if the
  charge would still be running. For example, 12 hours from 21:30 with
  23:30–05:30 off peak: 21:30–23:30, then 05:30–09:30.
- **Saving sessions** (below, with No charging during a session on) are
  left out too, but the charge carries on that much later so it keeps its
  hours (ending at a ready time your supplier accepts); one that starts
  during a session plugs in at its end for its full hours. For example,
  3 hours from 17:55 with an 18:00–19:00 session: 17:55–18:00, then
  19:00–22:00.
- With a [daily limit](#your-suppliers-daily-limit) (Octopus: 6 hours) and
  Force schedule on supplier on: a charge longer than the limit is
  scheduled for the limit only, the earliest hours first (e.g. 12 hours from
  16:30 with 23:30–05:30 off peak: 16:30–22:30). If it takes a day over the
  limit, the next scheduled slot starts later, just enough to get back
  within it (for example, 4 hours scheduled 23:30–03:30 and a 3-hour auto
  plug-in at 18:00: that night's slot starts at 00:30). Without a limit,
  the whole charge is scheduled.
- If it meets or overlaps scheduled slots, they become one slot, ending at
  whichever ends last: the charge's end, or the slot's unplug if that's
  later. The slots' own plug-ins and unplugs inside it are skipped that
  once (so they don't set the ready time back, or end the charge early).
- The supplier's ready time is set to the end of the slot (E.ON Next has
  none to set).
- Deleting the charge's slot puts back what it changed: a slot it trimmed
  or joined goes back to how it was.

The entries show on the Automations tab as orange **Auto plug-in**, pink
**Charge now** or brown **Car plugged in** slots, and run even with the
schedule off. A slot that was trimmed keeps its own colour.

### Off-peak times

**Off-peak times** are times nothing is scheduled in, on the days you
pick, e.g. your off-peak hours (23:30–05:30) when the car may well charge
anyway. They're part of the schedule on the Automations tab: add one as you
would a slot (click or drag across a day, or **+ Add a slot**) and choose
**Off-peak time**; click one to change its times or days, or delete it. Slots can't be added in them (and one
can't be added over existing slots), and auto plug-in, the car plugged in
sensor and Charge now are planned around them (above). At the start of
each, it unplugs if the car is plugged in (by hand or from Home Assistant,
say), as nothing should charge then. They're shown hatched in blue-grey.

### Saving sessions

The **Saving sessions** card on the Automations tab (off by default) keeps
the car's charging out of your supplier's saving sessions, read from a Home
Assistant calendar: every upcoming event in it is a session. The calendar
is read every 5 minutes, up to 8 days ahead.

- **Calendar:** found automatically: Octopus Energy's
  `calendar.octopus_energy_<account>_octoplus_power_down` (or the older
  `..._octoplus_saving_sessions`), from the Octopus Energy integration; or
  another calendar whose ID or name mentions saving or saver sessions, power
  down or demand flexibility (E.ON Next, EDF). Octopus's Power Up and free
  electricity calendars are left out. Pick yours if it isn't found.
- **No charging during a session** (its own switch, on by default): each
  session is an off-peak time for that day only. Auto plug-in, the car
  plugged in sensor and Charge now unplug for it and plug back in after, as
  for a weekly off-peak time. A slot in the schedule that runs into it
  keeps its end time (its ready time) and its hours, so it starts earlier by
  the time the session takes out of it. For example, a 15:30–21:30 slot with
  an 18:00–19:00 session becomes 14:30–18:00 and 19:00–21:30; a 17:30–18:30
  slot with a 17:00–19:00 session becomes 16:00–17:00. If that meets an
  earlier slot they join. If starting earlier would be in the past (e.g.
  the session is found at 14:40), the slot keeps its start and ends later
  instead: 15:30–18:00 and 19:00–22:30, around any off-peak time,
  unplugging at a ready time your supplier accepts (with Force schedule on
  supplier), and joining the next slot if it meets it. A slot already
  running when the session is found unplugs for it (straight away, if it's
  begun) and carries on after it the same way. The weekly entries are
  skipped that day and the new times are added as one-offs. Sessions are
  shown hatched on the schedule.
- **Plug in before a session** (off by default), with **Charge for** hours:
  as soon as a session is known, a charge for that long before it is added
  to the schedule as one-offs (purple), ending as the session starts. Only
  the time the schedule doesn't already have the car plugged in is added:
  nothing if a slot already covers it (e.g. a slot moved to end as the
  session starts), and a slot it meets is joined. Not in an off-peak time
  or the past (a session found late gets what's left, not under 15
  minutes). With Force schedule on supplier, if that takes a day over the
  daily limit, the next slot after the session starts that much later, as
  for a car plugged in. Turning it off, or changing the hours, takes it out
  or redoes it.
- A session taken out of the calendar before it starts puts back the slots
  it moved. Turning **No charging during a session** off puts them all back,
  and turning the card off forgets the sessions too.

### Schedule, auto re-plug and start-up

- **Schedule** (**Automations** tab): today and the next 6 days are
  shown as slots, each running from a plug-in to its unplug, coloured by
  type: weekly (blue), one-off (teal), auto plug-in (orange), Charge now
  (pink), the car plugged in sensor (brown), the charge before a saving
  session (indigo) and a slot moved for a saving session (purple). **+ Add a
  slot** starts a new one at the next free 2 hours. A
  green line shows when it has charged today (hover for the session's
  energy, length and what ended it; click to open it on the Sessions tab),
  and your supplier's slots are outlined. Earlier days are on the Sessions
  tab. Click or drag across a day to add a slot; click a slot to change its times, the days it repeats on
  (**Every week**) or its date (**Once**), turn it off (**Active**), delete it
  (a weekly slot asks: every week, or just this one), or skip it once (its
  plug-in and unplug both don't run; it shows hatched, and **Undo skip** puts
  it back). A slot that's going now has **Stop for today**: it unplugs now
  and runs again next time. **No unplug** leaves it plugged in until you
  unplug it or another unplug time comes. Changes are saved straight away. An unplug
  time with no plug-in before it (e.g. "unplug at 07:00 every day", to
  unplug anything left plugged in) shows as a small tick, and can be
  changed or deleted the same way. Times are in your Home Assistant time
  zone. A plug-in time missed while the add-on was stopped isn't run later
  (if it starts inside a plugged-in stretch it plugs in, see below). An
  unplug time is never left behind: one missed while the add-on was stopped
  or restarting (within a day, and if nothing in the schedule has come since)
  unplugs as soon as it's back, also with **Continue session after a
  restart** on, and an unplug that was waiting for the supplier to stop the
  session carries on after a restart. Unplugging during a session ends the
  session.
- **One-off slots:** a **Once** slot runs on its date only. Once it has
  run it's kept for 14 days: sessions on the **Sessions** tab that ran in
  a one-off slot are tagged **One-off** (or **Auto plug-in** / **Charge
  now**). A skipped unplug isn't used for the ready time.
- **Random start delay** (**Automations** tab, under the schedule, off by
  default): each of your slots plugs in a random time after it starts, up
  to the minutes set (1 to 60, 10 by default) and at most half the slot, so
  it isn't the same time every day, e.g. a 23:30 slot plugs in at 23:34 one
  night and 23:38 the next. Only your own slots: auto plug-in, the car
  plugged in sensor, Charge now and the charge before a saving session plug
  in straight away, as does a slot that starts where another ends or while
  it's already plugged in. The Overview and the Automations banner show
  "Plug in at … (random delay)" meanwhile. If the slot ends, is skipped or
  the schedule's turned off before then, it doesn't plug in; turning the
  delay off plugs in straight away. Plugged in by hand meanwhile, it's left
  as it is. The ready time (Force schedule on supplier) is set when it plugs
  in (or is plugged in). The minutes can be set with the delay off.
- **Restarts:** a plug-in waiting out its random start delay still waits
  after a restart. Restarted where two slots meet (e.g. stopped from 11:59
  to 12:02 with 06:00–12:00 and 12:00–18:00), it stays plugged in, and the
  ready time is set for the new slot. A charge from auto plug-in, the car
  plugged in sensor or Charge now that started while the add-on was stopped
  is plugged in at start-up too, with the schedule off as well.
- **Clocks going forward:** a time that doesn't exist that night (01:00–01:59
  in the UK) runs at 02:00, and a slot that's all in that hour doesn't run.
- **Starting inside a scheduled stretch:** if the add-on starts (or
  restarts) while the schedule has the car plugged in, e.g. at 02:00 with
  plug in 23:30 and unplug 07:00, and Plugged In is off, it plugs in
  straight away (and with Force schedule on supplier, sets the ready time
  once Home Assistant is connected). It never unplugs at start-up.
- **Force schedule on supplier** (**Automations** tab, off by default):
  when the schedule plugs in, the add-on sets your supplier's smart
  charging ready-by time to the schedule's next unplug, for example plug in
  02:00 and unplug 04:00 sets 04:00; plug in 06:00 and unplug 08:00 sets
  08:00. Only at scheduled plug-ins. Ready times are in 30-minute steps:
  Octopus Energy accepts any time of day, EDF Energy 04:00 to 11:00. While
  it's on, unplug times in the schedule are limited to those (the slot
  editor only offers those). E.ON Next's integration
  has no ready time setting. While it's on, the Automations tab outlines
  the schedule's slots in grey, and the schedule keeps to your supplier's
  [daily limit](#your-suppliers-daily-limit) (Octopus: 6 hours from 12:00 to
  12:00; none for the others): slots that go over are marked in red, and a
  change that goes over is only saved if you say so (the same for putting
  a skipped slot back). A charge earlier in the day counts too; if that's
  already over (e.g. after **Charge anyway**), slots can still be changed
  as long as it doesn't get worse. If Force schedule on
  supplier can't be turned on because of this (or an unplug time your
  supplier doesn't accept), the reason stays in red under the switch, with
  the slots to change marked in red, until it's fixed. With Force schedule
  on supplier off (or **Scheduling guards** overridden, Diagnostics ›
  Debug), there's no limit.
  At a scheduled unplug during a charging session, it waits for your
  supplier to stop the session itself (so it ends cleanly), then unplugs;
  if the supplier hasn't stopped it in time, it unplugs anyway. The wait
  is set under the switch (**Wait for the supplier at unplug**, 60 s by
  default, 0 to unplug straight away). The Overview shows "Unplugging by …"
  meanwhile.
  **Supplier's plan**: while the schedule has the car plugged in,
  the add-on checks your supplier's planned slots up to the ready time it
  set against the schedule. With plug-ins 16:00–18:00 and 20:00–22:00, the
  first stretch is checked from 16:00 (slots up to 18:00) and the second
  from 20:00 (slots up to 22:00). It's flagged if a slot runs past the
  unplug, or if the supplier's ready time was changed (e.g. in its app)
  from the one the schedule set. The check starts 5 minutes after the
  plug-in, to give the supplier time to plan, and follows the plan as it
  changes. The result shows on the Overview's Smart charging card and the
  Automations tab; a mismatch also as a red chip on the Overview, and in the
  log. The supplier's planned slots are outlined in its colour on the
  Automations tab (whether or not this is on).
- **Back-to-back slots** (one ends as the next starts, e.g. 06:00–12:00 and
  12:00–18:00): at 12:00 it unplugs straight away (without waiting for your
  supplier) and plugs back in after the re-plug **Unplugged for** time, so
  each slot is its own charge with its own ready time (12:00, then 18:00).
  With Octopus resetting its limit at 12:00, that's 6 hours each side.
  With Force schedule on supplier on and a reset time, a slot longer than
  the daily limit across the reset time (e.g. 08:00–18:00) is split there
  when it's saved, into two slots that work this way; so is a charge from
  auto plug-in, the car plugged in sensor or Charge now (including one
  joined with a scheduled slot).
- **Auto re-plug** (**Automations** tab): Octopus sometimes doesn't start a session after you plug
  in. When Plugged In has been on for the set minutes (default 10) with no
  session and the add-on is connected, it unplugs, waits the set
  **Unplugged for** seconds (default 30) and
  plugs back in, up to the set number of tries (default 3). It then gives up
  until the car is next unplugged or a session starts, and the wait starts
  again after each re-plug. If your supplier's smart charging plan is found
  (see the Overview tab), a planned slot counts too: it only re-plugs when
  nothing has been scheduled after the set minutes, not while it waits for
  a slot later on. A slot that's running now with no session is different:
  the status shows **Waiting for supplier** (amber) instead of Scheduled,
  and since Octopus may only start a session at the next half hour (e.g.
  after the add-on restarted mid-slot), the wait counts from the next :00
  or :30: with no session the set minutes after that, it re-plugs.
  It doesn't re-plug when the schedule unplugs before the car would be
  plugged back in (the **Unplugged for** time plus a minute), and it doesn't
  plug back in if a scheduled unplug came while it was unplugged.
- **Simulated car** (**Settings** tab): after StartTransaction (or resuming
  after a charging-profile pause) the simulated car pauses (**Pause before
  drawing power**, default 3 s) before drawing current, then ramps linearly
  to full power over the **Ramp-up** (default 5 s). 0 and 0 = full power
  straight away. Not used when power comes from your power sensor (the card
  is greyed out then). Not to be confused with the schedule's **Random start
  delay**, which is in minutes and delays the plug-in itself.

The schedule and auto re-plug are saved in `/data/automation.json` (and
when the schedule was last checked in `/data/automation_runtime.json`), auto
plug-in and your sensors in `/data/sensors.json`.

## Moving to another install

To move the add-on to another install of it without entering anything again,
e.g. from the `ocpp_charge_proxy` repository's add-on to the `HA_Addons` one
(or to a new Home Assistant):

1. On the old add-on (2.54.0 or later: update it first), **Diagnostics ›
   Move to another install › Export**. It downloads one file with:
   - the Configuration tab (server, chargepoint ID, the password unless you
     untick **With the password**, and the charger's details);
   - the schedule and everything else on the Automations tab, your sensors
     and supplier settings, the page's settings, the max current and the
     simulated car;
   - the charger's serial number and its lifetime energy register (your
     supplier knows the charger by these);
   - your supplier changes (`suppliers.json`), if you have any;
   - with **With the history** (on by default), the session history and the
     OCPP message log.

   The file has your password in it unless you leave it out: keep it
   somewhere private.
2. **Stop the old add-on.** Both would connect to your supplier as the same
   chargepoint, and make the same Home Assistant entities.
3. Install and start the new one, open its page, and on **Diagnostics › Move
   to another install › Import** choose the file. It shows what's in it (and
   warns if the old add-on is still running) before anything changes.
4. **Import and restart.** Its Configuration tab is set from the file, the
   rest is put in place as it starts again, and the page reconnects.
5. Uninstall the old add-on.

The Overview's charts and the energy dashboard are Home Assistant's own
history of the add-on's sensors: with the same entity IDs they carry on by
themselves. Not moved: what's only for the moment (a session in progress,
messages held while offline, Plugged In). The energy register never goes
backwards: if the new install's is already higher, it's kept.

## When your supplier changes something

Everything the add-on knows about a supplier is in its **supplier defaults**,
not its code: the daily limit and when it resets, the ready times its app
accepts, the names of its smart charging sensor, the attributes and fields
its planned slots are in, its ready time entity, the words that pick out its
saving sessions calendar, its colour on the page, and its Home Assistant
integration. So when a supplier (or its integration) changes something, it
can usually be followed by changing a setting, without a new version of the
add-on.

**Noticing.** The add-on checks the supplier integration's data every 10
minutes, and the Overview's Smart charging card and **Diagnostics › Health**
say when something looks wrong (an amber **Check**). The log says it too.
For example:

- its smart charging sensor is there, but without the attribute the slots
  are in (`planned_dispatches` for Octopus Energy and EDF Energy);
- the slots are there, but not with the fields expected (`start`, `end`);
- its integration is in Home Assistant, but no smart charging sensor was
  found (fine if you're not on its smart charging tariff);
- its ready time entity wasn't found next to the sensor;
- the sensor is unavailable.

Health also shows each supplier integration's version, and for a week after
one is updated, from which version to which: the first thing to look at if
smart charging stops being found.

**Fixing it yourself.** The add-on reads `suppliers.json` from its own
folder in Home Assistant (`/addon_configs/<this add-on>/`, which you can
reach with the Samba share or the File editor add-on). It's read again
within a minute or so of changing, and Diagnostics › Health says whether
your changes are being used (or why not, if the file has a mistake: it's
left out then, and the add-on's own defaults are used). It only needs
what's different; `suppliers.example.json` in the same folder has the
add-on's own defaults, with what each field means, to copy from. For
example, if the Octopus Energy integration renamed `planned_dispatches` to
`planned_slots` and Octopus allowed 7 hours a day:

```json
{"suppliers": [
  {"name": "Octopus Energy", "planned_attribute": "planned_slots", "daily_limit_h": 7}
]}
```

A supplier with the same name has just those fields changed; a new name
adds a supplier. The fields:

| Field | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | How its integration shows the plan: `kraken` (a dispatching binary sensor and a ready time entity: Octopus Energy, EDF Energy) or `schedule_sensor` (a sensor with a schedule attribute: E.ON Next) |
| `integration` | Its Home Assistant integration's domain (e.g. `octopus_energy`), to notice when it's updated |
| `colour` | Its colour on the page, `#rrggbb` |
| `dispatch_prefix`, `dispatch_suffix` | `kraken`: the start and end of its dispatching sensor's entity ID |
| `planned_attribute`, `completed_attribute` | `kraken`: the sensor's attributes listing the planned and completed slots |
| `ready_entity_suffix` | `kraken`: what replaces `dispatch_suffix` for its ready time entity (`time.` or `select.`) |
| `schedule_sensor_suffix`, `schedule_attribute` | `schedule_sensor`: part of its sensor's entity ID, and the attribute with the slots |
| `slot_fields` | The names of each slot's `start`, `end`, `kwh` and `source` |
| `calendar_words` | Words in its saving sessions calendar's ID or name |
| `ready_times` | The ready times its app accepts, `{"from": "04:00", "to": "11:00"}`; `null`: none |
| `daily_limit_h`, `limit_reset` | Its daily limit in hours (`null`: none) and when it resets (`"12:00"`, or `"rolling"`) |

And `saving_sessions` (`words`, `not_words`, `prefer`) for finding the
saving sessions calendar. Anything set on Settings › Your supplier still
wins over all of these.

If a supplier's integration changes in a way these fields can't follow (a
new way of showing its plan), it needs a change to the add-on: each kind is
one file in `src/supplier_types/`, and a new kind is a new file there.

## How it works

1. The add-on connects to your supplier's OCPP server via WebSocket
2. It registers as a chargepoint (BootNotification)
3. It sends periodic heartbeats and meter values
4. When you "plug in" (the Plugged In helper or the web page), it reports
   `Preparing`
5. Your supplier creates a charge schedule and sends `RemoteStartTransaction`
6. The proxy sends `StartTransaction`, reports `Charging`, and sends meter
   values while the simulated car ramps up to full power
7. When the supplier ends the session, it sends `RemoteStopTransaction`
8. The proxy reports `Finishing`, sends `StopTransaction`, then returns to
   `Preparing`

If the connection drops, the add-on reconnects automatically, retrying after 5, 10
and 30 seconds, then every minute.

### While offline

Like a real charger, a dropped connection doesn't stop the session. Charging,
the energy register and any charging profile carry on, and the transaction
stays open. StartTransaction, StopTransaction and the session's MeterValues are
held in order and sent once the server accepts the BootNotification on
reconnect. Status updates and heartbeats aren't held; the current status is
sent after reconnecting instead. Held messages are saved to
`/data/offline_queue.json`, so they also survive an add-on restart. Up to
1,000 messages are held, and the oldest meter readings are dropped first.

If the add-on is stopped without warning mid-charge (power cut, crash), the
open transaction is closed on the next start. A StopTransaction with reason
`PowerLoss` is sent, using the last meter reading saved before the
interruption.

When the add-on is restarted mid-charge (an update, a restart from Home
Assistant), it leaves the session open by default
(**Continue session after a restart**, Settings › Controls): no StopTransaction or Unavailable, just
the connection closing, as when a charger loses its connection. When it's
back (within 10 minutes, with Plugged In still on) it reports Charging and
carries on with the same transaction, energy and charging profile.
Otherwise, or with the option off, the session is stopped with reason
`Reboot`, and your supplier starts a new one (Octopus at the next hour or
half hour). If the supplier sends a new RemoteStart instead of carrying on,
the old session is stopped (`Reboot`) and the new one started straight
away.

### StopTransaction readings

StopTransaction can include `transactionData` with the session's readings.
Two configuration keys choose what's included. Both are empty by default, as
on a Wallbox Pulsar Plus, so nothing is added unless your supplier sets them
with ChangeConfiguration:

| Key | Default | Readings |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `StopTxnSampledData` | *(empty)* | At the start, every `MeterValueSampleInterval`, and at the stop |
| `StopTxnAlignedData` | *(empty)* | On each `ClockAlignedDataInterval` boundary |

Long sessions are thinned to at most 100 readings, and the first and last are
always kept.

## Home Assistant entities

The add-on creates its own entities (no integration needed):

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `input_boolean.ocpp_charge_proxy_plugged_in` | Helper (toggle) | Plugged In: turn on/off to plug in or unplug. Kept in step with the add-on's own Plugged In |
| `input_button.ocpp_charge_proxy_charge_now_1h` … `_12h` | Helpers (buttons) | Charge now for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12 hours, as the Automations tab's Charge now buttons |
| `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_power` | Sensor | Current power draw (kW) |
| `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_energy` | Sensor | Cumulative energy (kWh, works with the Energy dashboard) |
| `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_current` | Sensor | Current draw (A) |
| `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_status` | Sensor | OCPP state (Available, Preparing, Charging...), or Scheduled / Waiting for supplier while plugged in with a supplier slot planned / running |
| `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_current_limit` | Sensor | Current the charger uses (A), with your max (`max_amps`) and the supplier's limit (`provider_limit_amps`) as attributes |

- The sensors are posted by the add-on, so they can't be renamed in the UI and
  aren't grouped under a device. They show as unavailable while the add-on is
  stopped, and come back when it (or Home Assistant) restarts.
- The Plugged In helper is a normal helper. While the add-on is stopped,
  toggling it does nothing, and it's set back to the add-on's value when the
  add-on starts.
- The Charge now buttons are normal helpers too: press one, or call
  `input_button.press` on it from an automation. It's added to the schedule
  as a one-off, as the web page's button does. An automation can't answer
  the page's "over the daily limit?" question, so a press always goes ahead
  (as auto plug-in does); the log says what was planned. Presses while the
  add-on is stopped are ignored. A deleted button comes back when the
  add-on reconnects to Home Assistant.
- If the old OCPP Charge Proxy integration (1.x) is still installed, the
  add-on leaves the sensors alone until you remove it (Settings > Devices &
  services). `sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_energy` keeps its entity ID, so its
  Energy dashboard history carries on.
- Your power and SoC sensors are set up on the web page's **Settings**
  tab, and auto plug-in and the car plugged in sensor on the **Automations** tab; the add-on
  reads them through Home Assistant's API.

## Web page

Open the add-on from the sidebar (or **Open Web UI**). It updates live and
follows your Home Assistant theme. Settings save as soon as you change them.

- **Header:** a health dot left of the title (green / amber / red) that
  opens Diagnostics › Health.
- **Overview:** state, power, current, SoC and energy; the current session;
  **smart charging** (the charge slots your supplier plans, found
  automatically from the Octopus Energy, EDF Energy or E.ON Next integration, also
  shown along the top of the chart);
  and a chart of power, current (with your max and the supplier limit) or
  SoC over the last 30 minutes to 24 hours, or 14 days. Drag across the
  chart or scroll over it to zoom (double-click or **Reset zoom** to go
  back). The charts and the
  energy for the last 7 days are read from Home Assistant's history of the add-on's
  sensors (keep them recorded): 10-second detail for 24 hours, then
  5-minute points while HA keeps them (10 days by default, `purge_keep_days`)
  and hourly beyond that.
- **Sessions:** a timeline of the last 7 days (when the car was plugged in,
  coloured by what plugged it in, when it charged, and each day's energy and
  time charging; click a day to show only its sessions, or a charge to open
  it), and the last 20 charging
  sessions (energy, duration, peak power, what ended them; transaction ID
  and ID tag in the details; tagged with your supplier's name, e.g.
  **Octopus Energy slot**, when the whole session was in its dispatch
  slots, or **Partly Octopus Energy slot** when only some was), kept across restarts,
  and the last 20 plug-ins that never got a session: when, for how long, who
  plugged in, and whether auto re-plug gave up on it or it was unplugged
  first.
- **Automations:**
  - The **Schedule** card's banner: what the schedule does next (and how
    long until, and what it did last), its On switch, and **Charge now**.
  - **Charge now** (in the banner): click how long to plug in for (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12
    hours). It plugs in straight away and adjusts the schedule the same way
    auto plug-in does (see [Auto plug-in](#auto-plug-in-the-car-plugged-in-sensor-and-charge-now)): a one-off slot
    in the schedule below, the ready time set to its end, and it unplugs
    then. **Cancel this charge** (after it's started) takes it out of the
    schedule again, puts back anything it changed, and unplugs unless a
    slot has the car plugged in. With your supplier's [daily
    limit](#your-suppliers-daily-limit) (Octopus: 6 hours) and Force
    schedule on supplier on, the banner says what it is, the lengths over
    it are marked, and a charge that would go over asks first, saying what
    would change; **Charge anyway** then goes ahead.
  - **Over the daily limit** (with Force schedule on supplier on): saving a slot, putting back a skipped one, turning on
    Force schedule on supplier or turning the scheduling guards back on
    with the schedule over the limit says so, with a button to go ahead
    anyway (**Save anyway**, **Put it back anyway**, **Turn on anyway**,
    **Turn back on anyway**). The hours past the limit then show as a red
    block of their own on the slot, e.g. 4 hours last night and a 3-hour
    slot this morning (the same day from 12:00): its last hour is red. Your
    supplier may not charge in them.
  - The plug-in schedule (see below): today and the next 6 days of when it
    has the car plugged in, and under it the **Random start delay**.
    While a plug-in waits out the delay, the banner and the Overview say
    when it'll plug in, and the slot is hatched until then.
  - **Your supplier:** Force schedule on supplier, the unplug wait and the
    supplier's plan check.
  - **Auto plug-in**, **Car plugged in** (the sensor for your car's real
    cable), **Saving sessions** and **Auto re-plug**: one card each.
- **Settings:** **Appearance**: **Colourful** (a coloured banner at the top
  of each tab, from blue to your supplier's colour, the default) or
  **Basic** (plain cards), saved in each browser; controls for **Plugged In
  (virtual)** (what your supplier sees: the add-on's charger cable, not your
  car's real one; also a **Plug in** / **Unplug** button on the Overview),
  max current and **Continue session after a restart**; the simulated car's
  pause and ramp-up; your
  power and SoC sensors, with their live values; the **Voltage** card (a
  voltage sensor, or a set supply voltage; 230 V if neither) used to turn
  amps into kW for the simulated power and the ~kW figures; and **Your
  supplier**, for when what's found automatically isn't right, or your
  supplier's rules change:
  - **Smart charging sensor:** the dispatching sensor with its planned
    slots (Octopus Energy / EDF Energy), or E.ON Next's schedule sensor.
  - **Ready time:** the target time entity Force schedule on supplier sets,
    and the **Ready times** it accepts (automatic: what the entity offers,
    any half hour for Octopus, 04:00–11:00 for the others).
  - **Daily limit:** the most hours of smart charging your supplier
    schedules in a day (automatic: 6 for Octopus Energy, none for the
    others; 0: no limit). Used for the schedule, auto plug-in and Charge now
    while Force schedule on supplier is on. **Resets** says when it starts
    again: every day at a set time (automatic for Octopus Energy: 12:00, so
    6 hours before midday and another 6 from midday are fine), or rolling
    (automatic for the others): no more than the limit in any period of the
    **Reset frequency** (24 hours unless changed, 1–168 hours). If a change
    means the schedule no longer fits, the card offers to clear the
    schedule's charging slots (off-peak times stay), put the setting
    back, or keep both and shorten the slots yourself. With a reset time, "any 24 hours" below means each day from
    that time, and a charge across it can be longer: 08:00 for 12 hours is
    08:00–18:00 (4 hours before 12:00, then 6 after).
  Each shows what's in use, and whether it was found or picked.
  The automatic values come from the supplier defaults (`src/suppliers.json`,
  with your own changes on top: see [When your supplier changes
  something](#when-your-supplier-changes-something)); anything set on this
  tab still wins.
- **Diagnostics**, in two parts:
  - **Health:** version, uptime, reconnects and the last drop's reason,
    heartbeat and clock offset, the Home Assistant link and the add-on's
    Home Assistant entities, and any held messages. At the bottom,
    **Supplier**: what your supplier has set: charging limits, charging
    profiles drawn as a timeline, the local authorisation list and every
    configuration key.
  - **Debug:** tools for testing and bug reports:
    - Test values: a power override (reported instead of the simulation)
      and a test SoC.
    - **Send a message** now as the charger: a StatusNotification (any
      status; it doesn't change the charger's own state), MeterValues, a
      Heartbeat or a BootNotification, with the supplier's reply.
    - **Drop the connection** for a number of seconds (charging carries on
      and transaction messages are held, as on a real dropout), or
      **restart the add-on** (through the Supervisor; a session carries on
      after it with **Continue session after a restart** on).
    - **Scheduling guards** (off by default): override them to let the
      schedule, auto plug-in and Charge now plug in for more than Octopus's
      6 hours a day while Force schedule on supplier is on.
    - **Logs:** the log level (Debug, Info, Warning), kept across
      restarts, and the last 300 OCPP messages both ways, kept across
      restarts (with a marker where the add-on restarted), with a filter,
      full JSON on click and a Copy button for sharing.
    - **Diagnostics bundle:** one JSON file with the state, schedule,
      sessions, supplier's plan and settings, health, recent messages, log
      lines and options (password and most of the chargepoint ID hidden).
    - **Clear data:** the session history or the message log.

Times on the page are 24-hour. Longer explanations are behind **More**
links.

## Getting your OCPP credentials

Your supplier will give you three values needed to connect:

- **Server hostname** — the OCPP WebSocket endpoint
- **Chargepoint ID** — your unique chargepoint identifier
- **Password** — authentication password

You may also need to set `charger_model` and `charger_vendor` to match a
charger model your supplier supports. The defaults work for suppliers that
accept Wallbox chargepoints.

Check your supplier's app or documentation for how to obtain these credentials.
