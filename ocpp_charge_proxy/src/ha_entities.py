"""The add-on's own Home Assistant entities (no integration needed).

- Plugged In: an input_boolean helper the add-on creates
  (input_boolean.ocpp_charge_proxy_plugged_in). Turning it on/off in HA
  plugs in / unplugs; the add-on keeps it in step with its own Plugged In
  (web page, schedule, auto plug-in...). The add-on is the source of truth:
  while it's stopped the helper can be toggled but nothing happens, and it's
  set back when the add-on reconnects.
- Power, Energy and Current: posted as sensor states
  (sensor.ocpp_charge_proxy_power / _energy / _current), with the device and
  state classes the Energy dashboard needs. They're "unavailable" while the
  add-on is stopped, and re-posted when it (or HA) restarts.
- Status (the OCPP state: Charging, Preparing..., or Waiting for supplier /
  Scheduled while plugged
  in with a slot planned by your supplier) and Current limit (the
  current the charger uses, with your max and the supplier's limit as
  attributes). HA records all of these, and the web page's charts and daily
  energy are read back from that history (src/ha_history.py).

Kept free of I/O so the decisions can be tested on their own; HaLink does the
talking.
