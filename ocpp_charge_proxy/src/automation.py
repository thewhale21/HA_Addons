"""Plug-in schedule and automatic re-plug.

- Schedule: switch Plugged In on or off at set times, on chosen days, as
  many times a day as you like. Times are local (the add-on's TZ, which Home
  Assistant sets to your configured time zone). A plug-in time missed while
  the add-on was stopped isn't caught up; an unplug is (see due()).
- Re-plug: if the car is plugged in but the supplier hasn't started a
  session after `after_min` minutes, unplug, wait REPLUG_WAIT_S seconds and
  plug back in, up to `attempts` times. The count resets when a session
  starts or when the car is unplugged by anything else. If your supplier's
  smart charging plan is available (src/smart_charging.py), a slot planned
  for later counts as an answer: no re-plug while one is planned, only when
  nothing has been scheduled `after_min` minutes after plugging in. A slot
  running now doesn't: the supplier should be charging. But it may only
  start a session at the next half hour (Octopus does, e.g. after the
  add-on restarted mid-slot), so the wait is counted from then: with no
  session `after_min` minutes after the next :00 or :30, it re-plugs.

- One-off times: an entry with a `date` runs once, on that day, and is
  removed after it has run. Skips: any upcoming slot (a plug-in and its
  unplug, weekly or one-off) can be skipped once; skipped times don't
  run, and the skips are forgotten a day after.
- Auto plug-in charge: when auto plug-in (low SoC) switches Plugged In on
  and its "set my supplier's ready time" option is on, plan_auto_plug adds
  a one-off slot to the schedule: plug in now, unplug at the first ready
  time your supplier accepts at least the chosen hours away. If that puts
  more than Octopus's 6 hours in 24 (only checked with Force schedule on
  supplier on, as for the schedule), the next scheduled slot starts that
  much later (its first hours move to now). If it then meets or overlaps
  the next scheduled slot, the two become one slot. The ready time is set
  for the end of the slot. Its entries carry "source": "auto_plug" and run
  even with the schedule off.
- At start-up: if the schedule is on and the add-on starts inside a
  plugged-in stretch (the last schedule time before now was a plug-in) with
  Plugged In off, it plugs in, as if it had been running at that time.
- Graceful unplug: with the ready time on (Force schedule on supplier), a
  scheduled unplug during a session waits up to `unplug_wait_s` (default
  GRACEFUL_UNPLUG_S, set on the page; 0 = don't wait) for the supplier to
  stop the session itself (RemoteStop), then unplugs.
- Plan check: with the ready time on, while the schedule has the car
  plugged in, the supplier's planned slots up to the ready time are checked
  against the schedule (src/plan_check.py); a mismatch is shown on the page.
- Saving sessions (src/saving_sessions.py): with "off-peak time" on, each
  upcoming session from the calendar is an off-peak time (as the weekly
  ones: auto plug-in, Charge now... unplug for it), and a scheduled slot that
  runs into it keeps its end and its length but isn't plugged in during the
  session, so it starts that much earlier (15:30–21:30 with an 18:00–19:00
  session: 14:30–18:00 and 19:00–21:30), as one-offs (the weekly entries are
  skipped that day). What a session changed is put back if it's cancelled.
  With "plug in before" on, a charge of the chosen hours before it is added
  to the schedule as soon as the session is known, for the time the schedule
  doesn't already cover (sync_saving_sessions, _plan_precharge).
- Off-peak times: at the start of each, it unplugs if plugged in (by hand,
  Home Assistant...), as nothing should charge then (block_starts_due).
- Random start delay: optionally, each of your slots' plug-ins waits a random
  time (up to the minutes set, and at most half the slot) before plugging in,
  so it isn't the same time every day. Not car slots (auto plug-in, Charge
  now...), which start straight away, nor where two slots meet. If the slot
  ends, is skipped or the schedule is turned off meanwhile, it doesn't plug in.
- Ready time: optionally, when the schedule plugs in, set your supplier's
  smart charging ready-by time to the schedule's next unplug
  (src/ready_time.py). Only at a scheduled plug-in.

Settings are saved in /data/automation.json and set on the web page's
Automations tab. Until they're saved, re-plug uses the defaults.
